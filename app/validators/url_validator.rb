  # These are the rules checked by the *server*.  The client does some
  # quick sanity checks (see app/projects/new.html.erb), which should not
  # forbid anything we'd allow, but we can't trust
  # those checks because an attacker can easily bypass client-side checks.
  # The URL validation rules are somewhat overly strict, but should serve;
  # the idea is to prevent attackers from inserting redirecting URLs
  # that can sometimes be used to attack third-party sites via the BadgeApp.
  # For example, this does *not* include "?...", or ones with <, and the
  # use of %-encoded bytes is restricted.
  # We can gradually loosen this if needed.  Note that this pattern is
  # more restrictive than the ones we allow in markdown justifications,
  # because the BadgeApp doies *not* follow those URLs for further processing.
  # This regex is our creation, because we're trying to prevent certain URLs
  # that by *spec* are legal.  The first part is an expression of the DNS spec,
  # the latter simply limits the character set used in the path.
