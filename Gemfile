# frozen_string_literal: true

# This lists all gems we directly depend on.
# We depend on explicit version numbers (so we can control upgrade times).
# Any one gem is listed no more than once (to prevent referring to
# different version numbers in different environments).

# KEEP IN SYNC WITH .github/dependabot.yml, which proposes our gem updates
# on a schedule. Two kinds of decision recorded here are mirrored there,
# and changing one without the other silently loses its effect:
#
# * A gem pinned to an exact version below, or capped with "<", is one
#   whose upgrades we time by hand rather than take routinely. Those gems
#   are named in that file's "gems-minor" exclude-patterns, so a minor
#   bump arrives as its own pull request rather than inside the weekly
#   batch of low-risk updates.
#
# * A cap that records a KNOWN DEFECT rather than a version we simply have
#   not reached yet is ALSO listed there under "ignore". The two say
#   different things: a cap here means "do not resolve to that version",
#   while the ignore means "do not propose it at all". That distinction
#   matters because Dependabot is configured to raise our ceilings when a
#   newer version needs the room, so a cap alone is not a durable block.
#
# So when you add, remove, or loosen a pin or a cap below, open that file.

# The Rails release train moves as one. Its gems pin each other with "=",
# not "~>", so railties 8.1.3.1 requires exactly activesupport 8.1.3.1 and
# actionpack 8.1.3.1; updating one alone cannot resolve. Update all of their
# versions below together, then run this:
# bundle update actionmailer actionpack actionview activejob activemodel \
#        activerecord activesupport railties rails
#
# rails-i18n is NOT part of that set, though it used to be listed here. It
# requires "railties >= 8.0.0, < 9", so any Rails 8.x satisfies it and it
# can move on its own schedule. The exception is a MAJOR upgrade: going to
# Rails 9 needs the rails-i18n constraint below widened in the same commit,
# because rails-i18n 8.x refuses railties 9. Nothing proposes that pair
# automatically, so it is a hand edit when the time comes.

# NOTE: When updating you may see a spurious message like this:
#   WARN: Unresolved or ambiguous specs during Gem::Specification.reset:
#       stringio (>= 0)
#       Available/installed versions of this gem:
#       - 3.1.7
#       - 3.1.1
#   WARN: Clearing out unresolved specs. Try 'gem cleanup <gem>'
# It's basically spurious. Run `gem cleanup stringio` and move on.

# Important: we use `require: false` for many gems, including
# various linters, as is typical. Every one of them is run as a separate
# process ("bundle exec rubocop", "bundle exec license_finder", ...),
# so *always* loading the library into the application buys nothing and
# would cost about 1.3 seconds on EVERY rake task start. Measured:
# rubocop 0.86s, rubocop-rails 0.30s, license_finder 0.09s,
# rails_best_practices 0.04s. RuboCop's extensions are loaded by
# .rubocop.yml's "plugins:" inside that separate process.

# As a result, sawyer calls Kernel#load (the file-loader)

# Gem omniauth-rails_csrf_protection protects omniauth logins and

# Gem omniauth 1.x series has vulnerability CVE-2015-9284 if GET requests

# OmniAuth gem 2.x requires POST requests by default, which is a
# security improvement.
# However, omniAuth 2.x uses Rack's built-in AuthenticityToken class,
# NOT Rails' CSRF system. When using Rails, we need to instead use Rails'
# ActionController::RequestForgeryProtection for CSRF protection.

  # Spring, a preloader that keeps the application resident so repeated
  # commands start instantly. Commented out 2026-08-05 rather than
  # deleted, because reinstating it is this one line plus two in the
  # binstubs. Three reasons, in order of weight:
  #
  # * It is EASILY AND QUIETLY DISABLED, and was. Spring only intercepts
  #   commands through bin/ binstubs, and commit fa8b3645 regenerated
  #   those in August 2025, dropping the "load .../spring" line from
  #   bin/rails and bin/rake as a side effect. Nobody noticed for months,
  #   because nothing fails when a preloader silently stops preloading:
  #   things are merely slower. A dependency whose absence is invisible
  #   is a poor dependency to carry.
  # * It needs SPECIAL COMMANDS to do anything. It hooks binstubs, so it
  #   helps "bin/rake" and "bin/rails", while AGENTS.md tells developers
  #   to type plain "rake" and "rails", which go through the rbenv shims
  #   to the gem executables and never reach bin/. As used here it would
  #   have to change how everyone types every command.
  # * It HELPS LESS THAN IT DID. When boots were 8 to 11 seconds it was
  #   worth real inconvenience. Turning Bootsnap on for development and
  #   keeping the linters out of the application brought "rails console"
  #   to 4.6s, "rake -T" to 2.3s, and rake tasks that need no Rails to
  #   0.6s. What is left for a preloader to win is much smaller, and the
  #   price is a resident daemon holding a cached copy of the app that
  #   must be restarted when configuration changes.
  #
  # Rails itself agrees: Spring is no longer in the Gemfile that
  # "rails new" generates, as of Rails 7.
