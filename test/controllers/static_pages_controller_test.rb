    # There's a weird test environment artifact I haven't been
    # able to track down.  The view response sometimes has an original url of
    # http://127.0.0.1:31337 and other times it's http://www.example.com.
    # Values such as "request.host" are consistently the second value.
    # This doesn't happen when we only test this file, but instead happens
    # when there's a full "rails test" - which means some other test
    # causes this.  It seems to be an artifact of the test environment, and
    # not actually a bug in the deployed code, so the test here will be
    # flexible to handle the variations that occur in the test environment.

    # We'll use assert_select to check that it's being interpreted correctly.
    # The Rails documentation is *terribly* outdated.  It claims this works:
    # assert_select 'link[rel="alternate"][hreflang="x-default"][href=?]',
    # but Rails 4.2 changed the required syntax to use ":match".  See:
