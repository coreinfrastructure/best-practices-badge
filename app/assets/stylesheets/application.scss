/*
 * Rails asset pipeline manifest for application CSS
 * Reorganized to use explicit @import order (we don't use require_tree)
 *
 * For ease of maintenance, we organize CSS in many files.
 * However, the style commands are merged together on deployment.
 * So if you want CSS to apply in only some cases, make sure that
 * your CSS selector is adequately specific.
 *
 * External gem CSS loaded via Sprockets directives:
 *= require font_awesome5_webfont

// IMPORTANT: Shared variables are in _variables.scss
// Each SCSS file that uses variables must @import "variables" at the top.
// This must be done in each such file for the variables to work
// in Rails development mode, where files are compiled in isolation.

// 1. Bootstrap framework (must load FIRST)
// Note: bootstrap-sprockets provides Sass variables/mixins needed by bootstrap
// so you must import "bootstrap-sprockets" before "bootstrap".
@import "bootstrap-sprockets";
@import "bootstrap";

// 2. Bootstrap extensions (must load AFTER bootstrap)
@import "bootstrap-social";
@import "rails_bootstrap_forms";

// 3. Configuration & shared resources
@import "mixins";

// 4. Base styles (global elements and utilities)
@import "base";
@import "utilities";
@import "forms";

// 5. Layout components (must load AFTER Bootstrap for proper overrides)
@import "header";
@import "footer";

// 6. Controller-specific styles
@import "projects";
@import "users";
@import "sessions";
@import "static_pages";

// Empty placeholder files (included for completeness)
@import "project_stats";
@import "scaffolds";
