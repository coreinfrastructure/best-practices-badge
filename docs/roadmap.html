<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<p>The OpenSSF Best Practices badge project is essentially in a
&quot;sustainment&quot; mode.  That doesn&#39;t mean the project is static,
it just means that we&#39;ve already achieved our &quot;big&quot; objectives.
This is similar to the situation of the Linux kernel, which is
not static either but has also achieved its original key goals.</p>

<p>In particular, we&#39;ve met our original key objectives:</p>

<ul>
<li>created a set of tiered criteria (starting with 1 level),</li>
<li>a website so people can fill in those criteria and receive a badge</li>
<li>automation to help fill in some information</li>
<li>internationalization</li>
</ul>

<h2>Handle pull requests and issues</h2>

<p>At this point, we are primarily driven by specific pull requests and
issues, which have to be prioritized.</p>

<p>Since pull requests take much less time for us to process (in general),
and represent a more significant investment of time by the proposer
(so at least the proposer considers them important), they will tend to
be much more likely to be accepted.</p>

<p>Issues marked as &quot;next&quot; are also considered higher priority.</p>

<h2>General changes to expect in the future</h2>

<p>The following are general goals in the 1-2 year horizon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Continue to let others know about the badging program</li>
<li>Encourage projects to get &amp; display a badge and/or pursue higher levels</li>
<li>Add more automation for filling in projects</li>
<li>Add more locales</li>
<li>Update the criteria annually as more is learned</li>
<li>Reduce monthly hosting costs (without hurting user experience)</li>
</ul>

<p>The timeframe for many of these will depend on how much other people
provide support for them (this is especially true for adding new locales).</p>
