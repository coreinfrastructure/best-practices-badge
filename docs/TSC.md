# Technical Steering Committee (TSC) Members

<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: (MIT OR CC-BY-3.0+) -->

The members of the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge
Technical Steering Committee (TSC) are:

* David A. Wheeler (@david-a-wheeler) [The Linux Foundation]
* Christopher "CRob" Robinson (@SecurityCRob) [The Linux Foundation]
* Tony Hansen (@TonyLHansen) [AT&T]

Members represent themselves, not their employers.
We note employers because we want to ensure that no single organization
controls this project (the Linux Foundation represents other organizations
so we aren't worrying about that).

The initial "@" indicates the GitHub id.

TSC members do not necessarily have admin access to the production
web application, but they may.

See [governance](governance.md) for more information, as well as the
[Best Practices Badge Technical Charter](Best-Practices-Badge-Technical-Charter-Final-2024-04-30.pdf).
