# Rake tasks for BadgeApp

# If you use our standard development environment you usually
# don't need to prefix commands with "bundle exec" or "bin/" to ensure
# you're running in the correct Ruby virtual environment. That's because
# the rbenv system that we install makes those prefixes optional,
# eliminating the risk of forgetting them during development.
# However, rake tasks that *might* be run in the CI, staging, or production
# generally *must* include "bundle exec", because we don't run rbenv
# there. We use rbenv only as a development-time convenience, and try to
# minimize what we install in production, and we try to make our
# CI system similar to production.

# EVERY TASK WITH A BODY MUST SAY WHETHER IT NEEDS RAILS.
#
#   task foo: :environment do ... end   # uses models, Rails.root, ...
#   task foo: :no_rails    do ... end   # shells out, lints, moves files
#
# The Rakefile loads this file WITHOUT booting Rails, and boots only if
# the task you asked for needs it. That is worth six seconds on every
# invocation, and it is why "rake deploy_production" runs on a machine
# with no development environment at all.
#
# Saying nothing is not an option: "rake" refuses to run until the
# question is answered, naming the task. It also refuses if a task
# claims ":no_rails" and its body mentions Rails or a model. Both checks
# live in the Rakefile.
#
# Three things to know when adding one:
#
# * A "file" task cannot take the marker. Rake::Task#timestamp returns
#   Time.now, so a plain task as a file task's prerequisite would make it
#   out of date on every run. They are exempt, and so are tasks with no
#   body at all, which are pure prerequisite lists.
#
# * If your body INVOKES another task rather than depending on it, say
#   Rake::Task['db:migrate'].invoke, the marker cannot see it. Declare
#   ":environment" yourself in that case.
#
# * If your code must run after Rails and its gems have defined THEIR
#   tasks, because it enhances one of them, wrap it in
#   "after_rails_tasks do ... end". At file scope it would run too early,
#   and Rake::Task['whatever'] would raise.
#
# See the Rakefile for the mechanism and
# docs/build-environment-staleness.md for why.

# The work "rake default" does, split three ways, because CI runs the
# halves as separate jobs at the same time and a developer runs all of

# WHAT COUNTS AS A TEXT FILE, DECIDED BY GIT.
#
# This used to walk the working tree, ask file(1) what each path was,
# keep whatever it called text and drop whatever it called executable.
# Three things were wrong with that.
#
# The SCOPE FOLLOWED THE OPERATING SYSTEM, because file(1) answers out
# of a magic database that differs between releases. file on heroku-24
# calls our artwork "SVG Scalable Vector Graphics image" and skipped
# it; file on heroku-26 calls the same bytes text; so the stack upgrade
# in pull request 2948 failed on whitespace committed in 2016. A check
# listed under STATIC_CHECKS has to be settled by the commit.
#
# The EXECUTABLE EXEMPTION was meant for compiled files and never met
# one. file says "ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable" for those, with no
# "text" in it, so the first clause had already excluded them. What the
# exemption actually removed was every editable script carrying the
# execute bit: 43 tracked files, 20 of script/ among them.
#
# And the closing "xargs grep" had no "-0", so a path containing a
# space was split into pieces, grep failed on them, and the error went
# to /dev/null. Files with spaces in their names were never checked.
#
# "git grep -I" answers all three. The binary test is git's own, the
# same on every machine and overridable per path; it knows nothing of
# the execute bit; and no filename crosses a shell word boundary.
#
# TRACKED FILES ONLY, which is the point rather than a side effect: a
# scratch file nobody has added is not ours to fix.
#
# NO LIST OF BINARY FORMATS IS NEEDED. 91 tracked PNGs hold byte
# sequences that match this pattern, and "-I" drops every one, along
# with the gif, jpg, ico and pdf. Only formats that really are text
# need naming, which here means SVG.

# .github/dependabot.yml NAMES GEMS, AND A NAME THAT MATCHES NOTHING IS
# SILENT. Its bundler entry lists gems three ways: the Rails release train
# it groups, the gems whose minor bumps must leave the weekly batch, and
# the versions never to propose at all. Every one of those is a bare
# string compared against a dependency name, so a typo, a renamed gem, or
# a gem we dropped does not fail anything. It just quietly stops matching,
# and the protection it encoded is gone with no sign that it ever left.
#
# That is the same failure shape as an ignore rule hiding a tracked file:
# the mechanism keeps reporting success while doing nothing. So check that
# every name still refers to a real dependency.
#
# THE LOCKFILE, NOT THE GEMFILE, is the universe to check against. Four of
# the Rails gems the config groups (actioncable, actionmailbox, actiontext
# and activestorage) reach us through the development-only "gem 'rails'"
# and appear in no Gemfile line, which is exactly why they are named:
# before "allow: all" they were never offered an update at all.
#
# Wildcards are skipped. "*" is meant to match everything and would fail
# any name check by construction.

# A Renovate matchString that matches NOTHING is silent. The proposal
# still arrives, carrying whatever the other patterns found, and the
# file the dead pattern was meant to move is simply left behind.
#
# That is not hypothetical. Pull request 2941 changed .ruby-version
# alone, because the lock's pattern began with "^", and Renovate
# compiles matchStrings with the "g" flag and no "m" (see
# lib/modules/manager/custom/regex/strategies.ts), so "^" there is the
# start of the FILE and not of a line. Gemfile.lock begins with "GEM",
# so the pattern could never match anything, ever, and nothing said so.
# ruby_version_matches_lock above caught the consequence one pull
# request later. This catches the cause before one is opened.
#
# THE ANCHORS ARE TRANSLATED RATHER THAN TRUSTED. Ruby's "^" and "$"
# match at every line, so testing these patterns as Ruby reads them
# would pass precisely the config Renovate ignores, which is the bug
# itself. "\A" and "\z" are Ruby's beginning and end of data, which is
# what "^" and "$" mean to Renovate.

#
#   low_vowels     - fewer than 15% of letters are vowels (aeiou/y plus common
#                    accented Latin vowels). All human languages use vowels;
#                    a very low ratio strongly suggests a random string.
#
#   consonant_run  - 5 or more consecutive consonants within a single word.
#                    Even the most consonant-heavy natural languages rarely
#                    exceed 4 in a row.
#
#   rare_letters   - more than 35% of inner-word letters (excluding capitalised
#                    first letters, which are conventional in proper names) are
