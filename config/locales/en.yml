        <a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">Core Infrastructure Initiative
        (CII)</a> Best Practices badge is a way for Free/Libre and Open Source Software
        (FLOSS) projects to show that they follow best practices. Projects can voluntarily
        self-certify, at no cost, by using this web application to explain how they
        follow each best practice. The CII Best Practices Badge is inspired by the
        many badges available to projects on GitHub. Consumers of the badge will be
        able to quickly assess which FLOSS projects are following best practices and
        as a result are more likely to produce higher-quality secure software.

          Projects that follow the best practices below will be able to
          voluntarily self-certify and show that they've achieved a Core
          Infrastructure Initiative (CII) badge.
        details_html: >
          There is no set of practices that can guarantee that software will
          never have defects or vulnerabilities; even formal methods can fail
          if the specifications or assumptions are wrong. Nor is there any set
          of practices that can guarantee that a project will sustain a healthy
          and well-functioning development community. However, following best
          practices can help improve the results of projects. For example, some
          practices enable multi-person review before release, which can both
          help find otherwise hard-to-find technical vulnerabilities and help
          build trust and a desire for repeated interaction among developers
          from different companies. To earn a badge, all MUST and MUST NOT
          criteria must be met, all SHOULD criteria must be met OR be unmet
          with justification, <i>and</i> all SUGGESTED criteria must be met OR
          unmet (we want them considered at least). Feedback is welcome via the
          <a href="https://github.com/linuxfoundation/cii-best-practices-badge">GitHub site as issues or pull requests</a>

          and Schroeder</a>: <ul> <li>economy of mechanism (keep the design as simple
          and small as practical, e.g., by adopting sweeping simplifications) <li>fail-safe
          defaults (access decisions should deny by default, and projects'' installation
          should be secure by default) <li>complete mediation (every access that might
          be limited must be checked for authority and be non-bypassable) <li>open
          design (security mechanisms should not depend on attacker ignorance of its
          design, but instead on more easily protected and changed information like
          keys and passwords) <li>separation of privilege (ideally, access to important
          objects should depend on more than one condition, so that defeating one
          protection system won''t enable complete access. E.G., multi-factor authentication,
          such as requiring both a password and a hardware token, is stronger than
          single-factor authentication) <li>least privilege (processes should operate
          with the least privilege necessary) <li>least common mechanism (the design
          should minimize the mechanisms common to more than one user and depended
          on by all users, e.g., directories for temporary files) <li>psychological
          acceptability (the human interface must be designed for ease of use - designing
          for "least astonishment" can help) <li>limited attack surface (the attack
          surface - the set of the different points where an attacker can try to enter
          or extract data - should be limited) <li>input validation with whitelists
          (inputs should typically be checked to determine if they are valid before
          they are accepted; this validation should use whitelists (which only accept
          known-good values), not blacklists (which attempt to list known-bad values)).

          the project''s code base, is comfortable making changes to it, and is acknowledged

          typically make a number of contributions over the past year (via code, documentation,
          or answering questions). Developers would typically be considered primary
          developers if they initiated the project (and have not left the project
          more than three years ago), have the option of receiving information on
          a private vulnerability reporting channel (if there is one), can accept

          approach for doing this is by using a <a href="http://developercertificate.org/">Developer
          Certificate of Origin (DCO)</a>, where users add "signed-off-by" in their
          commits and the project links to the DCO website. However, this MAY be implemented
          as a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), or other legal mechanism.

'
        details: 'The DCO is the recommended mechanism because it''s easy to implement,
          tracked in the source code, and git directly supports a "signed-off" feature
          using "commit -s". To be most effective it is best if the project documentation
          explains what "signed-off" means for that project. A CLA is a legal agreement
          that defines the terms under which intellectual works have been licensed
          to an organization or project.  A contributor assignment agreement (CAA)
          is a legal agreement that transfers rights in an intellectual work to another
          party; projects are not required to have CAAs, since having CAA increases
          the risk that potential contributors will not contribute, especially if
          the receiver is a for-profit organization. The <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/">Apache
          Software Foundation CLAs (the individual contributor license and the corporate

          Then, if a vulnerability is found in a reused component, it will be
          easy to update that component.
        details: 'A typical way to meet this criterion is to use system and programming
          language package management systems. Many FLOSS programs are distributed
          with "convenience libraries" that are local copies of standard libraries
          (possibly forked). By itself, that''s fine. However, if the program *must*
          use these local (forked) copies, then updating the "standard" libraries
          as a security update will leave these additional copies still vulnerable.
          This is especially an issue for cloud-based systems; if the cloud provider
          updates their "standard" libaries but the program won''t use them, then
          the updates don''t actually help. See, e.g., <a href="http://spot.livejournal.com/312320.html">"Chromium:

      hardening:
        description: >
          Hardening mechanisms MUST be used in the software produced by
          the project so that software defects are less likely to
          result in security vulnerabilities.
        details: >
          Hardening mechanisms may include HTTP headers like Content
          Security Policy (CSP), compiler flags to mitigate attacks
          (such as -fstack-protector), or compiler flags to eliminate
          undefined behavior. For our purposes least privilege is not
          considered a hardening mechanism (least privilege is important,
          but separate).
      dynamic_analysis:
        description: >
          The project MUST apply at least one dynamic analysis tool to
          any proposed major production release of the software produced
          by the project before its release.
        details: >
          A dynamic analysis tool examines the software by executing it
          with specific inputs. For example, the project MAY use a fuzzing
          tool (e.g., <a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">American
          Fuzzy Lop</a>) or a web application scanner (e.g., <a
          href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project">OWASP
          ZAP</a> or <a
          href="http://w3af.org/">w3af</a>). In some cases the <a
          href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz#introduction">OSS-Fuzz</a>
          project may be willing to apply fuzz testing to your
          project. For purposes of this criterion the dynamic
          analysis tool needs to vary the inputs in some way
          to look for various kinds of problems <em>or</em> be an
          automated test suite with at least 80% branch coverage.  The <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_program_analysis">Wikipedia
          page on dynamic analysis</a> and the <a
          href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fuzzing">OWASP page on
          fuzzing</a> identify some dynamic analysis tools. The analysis
          tool(s) MAY be focused on looking for security vulnerabilities,
          but this is not required.
      dynamic_analysis_enable_assertions:
        description: >
          The project SHOULD include many run-time assertions in the software
          it produces and check those assertions during dynamic analysis.
