# Governance

This document briefly describes "how we make decisions" in the
CII Best Practices Badge Project.

## Overall

This project is a Linux Foundation (LF) Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)
project.
The CII is led by a steering committee who represent a variety of
organizations; see the
[CII FAQ](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/faq) for more information.

In terms of
["Governance models" (Gardler and Hanganu)](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/governancemodels) the badging project is a bazaar -
contributions are gladly welcomed from anyone.
The project is led by a single technical lead designated by the CII.
The technical lead has final say on decisions (and thus is
something of a "benevolent dictator"), but the technical
lead is subject to being overruled or replaced by the CII.
Also, since the project is FLOSS, the project can be forked;
this ability to fork also provides a check against despotism.
The technical lead's job is focus on doing what's best
for this project, and the project's goal is to help
the FLOSS community overall.

The technical lead has commit rights on the software, and administrative
rights to the production site, and can add or remove those rights to others.
Those with commit rights can make changes
(subject to caveats described below) and accept changes
(typically pull requests) submitted by others.
These changes include changes to the process and contribution requirements.

## Process

We generally use the GitHub issue tracker and pull requests for managing
changes.
For details, including contribution requirements, see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

Issues that we have determined are especially important, particularly
if they will take a while, are added to the "next" milestone
(which identifies "what should be prioritized next").

## Criteria changes

Changing *criteria* can have a much larger impact on participating
projects than simply changing the supporting software, so we have special
rules about them.  Fundamentally, any project that has honestly achieved
a badge has a right to *not* have it revoked without notice.

Criteria may be immediately changed if the change will
not change the *meaning* of the criteria, e.g.,
spelling corrections, grammar corrections, trivial reorderings,
and trivial clarifications.

Criteria may have clarifications and minor exceptions added, but there
must be an opportunity for discussion.
Our usual approach is to create an issue and mark it with
"criteria-clarification".

We expect that the criteria will need to be changed in more significant
ways over time, but these more significant changes *MUST* happen much
less often and projects *MUST* be given much more time to either (1) object
or (2) modify their project to comply *and* record that in the BadgeApp
(so that they retain their badges).
We currently expect that badge criteria will change at most 1/year,
and that projects will have at least 2 months' warning before the change.
In that 2-month time, the BadgeApp must provide the necessary mechanisms
(e.g., using "future" criteria) so that projects can record their new answers
and thus have ample time to prevent losing the badge.

## Current people

The current Badge Project technical lead is David A. Wheeler.
Others with commit rights include Dan Kohn and Jason Dossett.
