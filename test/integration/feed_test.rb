  # Historically we did a lot of special cases to hide time changes.
  # But these are really invasive and fragile, so I've commented them out.
  # The current tests simply check for data that should be there, and
  # ignoring times. It's just loading from a fixture file, so a more
  # sophisticated test isn't really justified.

  # Turn off transactional fixtures for this test since we are loading
  # the fixtures database anyway. This will prevent the timestamp change
  # from spilling into other tests.

  #   Ensure the test db has its environment metadata set to test,
