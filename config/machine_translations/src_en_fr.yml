      osps_ac_01_01:
        description: When a user attempts to read or modify a sensitive resource in the project's authoritative repository, the system MUST require the user to complete a multi-factor authentication process.
        details: Enforce multi-factor authentication for the project's version control system, requiring collaborators to provide a second form of authentication when accessing sensitive data or modifying repository settings. Passkeys are acceptable for this control.
      osps_ac_02_01:
        description: When a new collaborator is added, the version control system MUST require manual permission assignment, or restrict the collaborator permissions to the lowest available privileges by default.
        details: Most public version control systems are configured in this manner. Ensure the project's version control system always assigns the lowest available permissions to collaborators by default when added, granting additional permissions only when necessary.
      osps_ac_03_01:
        description: When a direct commit is attempted on the project's primary branch, an enforcement mechanism MUST prevent the change from being applied.
        details: If the VCS is centralized, set branch protection on the primary branch in the project's VCS. Alternatively, use a decentralized approach, like the Linux kernel's, where changes are first proposed in another repository, and merging changes into the primary repository requires a specific separate act.
      osps_ac_03_02:
        description: When an attempt is made to delete the project's primary branch, the version control system MUST treat this as a sensitive activity and require explicit confirmation of intent.

      osps_br_03_02:
        description: When the project lists a URI as an official distribution channel, that URI MUST be exclusively delivered using encrypted channels.
        details: Configure the project's release pipeline to only fetch data from websites, API responses, and other services which use encrypted channels such as SSH or HTTPS for data transmission.
      osps_br_07_01:
        description: The project MUST prevent the unintentional storage of unencrypted sensitive data, such as secrets and credentials, in the version control system.
        details: Configure .gitignore or equivalent to exclude files that may contain sensitive information. Use pre-commit hooks and automated scanning tools to detect and prevent the inclusion of sensitive data in commits.
      osps_do_01_01:
        description: When the project has made a release, the project documentation MUST include user guides for all basic functionality.
        details: Create user guides or documentation for all basic functionality of the project, explaining how to install, configure, and use the project's features. If there are any known dangerous or destructive actions available, include highly-visible warnings.
      osps_do_02_01:
        description: When the project has made a release, the project documentation MUST include a guide for reporting defects.
        details: It is recommended that projects use their VCS default issue tracker. If an external source is used, ensure that the project documentation and contributing guide clearly and visibly explain how to use the reporting system. It is recommended that project documentation also sets expectations for how defects will be triaged and resolved.
      osps_gv_02_01:
        description: While active, the project MUST have one or more mechanisms for public discussions about proposed changes and usage obstacles.
        details: Establish one or more mechanisms for public discussions within the project, such as mailing lists, instant messaging, or issue trackers, to facilitate open communication and feedback.

        description: While active, the project documentation MUST include an explanation of the contribution process.
        details: Create a CONTRIBUTING.md or CONTRIBUTING/ directory to outline the contribution process including the steps for submitting changes, and engaging with the project maintainers.
      osps_le_02_01:

        description: While active, the license for the released software assets MUST meet the OSI Open Source Definition or the FSF Free Software Definition.
        details: If a different license is included with released software assets, ensure it is an approved license by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), or a free license as approved by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). Examples of such licenses include the MIT, BSD 2-clause, BSD 3-clause revised, Apache 2.0, Lesser GNU General Public License (LGPL), and the GNU General Public License (GPL). Note that the license for the released software assets may be different than the source code.
      osps_le_03_01:
        description: While active, the license for the source code MUST be maintained in the corresponding repository's LICENSE file, COPYING file, or LICENSE/ directory.
        details: Include the project's source code license in the project's LICENSE file, COPYING file, or LICENSE/ directory to provide visibility and clarity on the licensing terms. The filename MAY have an extension. If the project has multiple repositories, ensure that each repository includes the license file.
      osps_le_03_02:
        description: While active, the license for the released software assets MUST be included in the released source code, or in a LICENSE file, COPYING file, or LICENSE/ directory alongside the corresponding release assets.
        details: Include the project's released software assets license in the released source code, or in a LICENSE file, COPYING file, or LICENSE/ directory alongside the corresponding release assets to provide visibility and clarity on the licensing terms.

      osps_qa_01_01:
        description: While active, the project's source code repository MUST be publicly readable at a static URL.
        details: Use a common VCS such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Ensure the repository is publicly readable. Avoid duplication or mirroring of repositories unless highly visible documentation clarifies the primary source. Avoid frequent changes to the repository that would impact the repository URL. Ensure the repository is public.
      osps_qa_01_02:
        description: The version control system MUST contain a publicly readable record of all changes made, who made the changes, and when the changes were made.
        details: Use a common VCS such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to maintain a publicly readable commit history. Avoid squashing or rewriting commits in a way that would obscure the author of any commits.
      osps_qa_02_01:
        description: When the package management system supports it, the source code repository MUST contain a dependency list that accounts for the direct language dependencies.
        details: This may take the form of a package manager or language dependency file that enumerates all direct dependencies such as package.json, Gemfile, or go.mod.
      osps_qa_04_01:
        description: While active, the project documentation MUST contain a list of any codebases that are considered subprojects.
        details: Document any additional subproject code repositories produced by the project and compiled into a release. This documentation should include the status and intent of the respective codebase.
      osps_qa_05_01:
        description: While active, the version control system MUST NOT contain generated executable artifacts.
        details: Remove generated executable artifacts in the project's version control system. It is recommended that any scenario where a generated executable artifact appears critical to a process such as testing, it should be instead be generated at build time or stored separately and fetched during a specific well-documented pipeline step.
      osps_qa_05_02:
        description: While active, the version control system MUST NOT contain unreviewable binary artifacts.
        details: Do not add any unreviewable binary artifacts to the project's version control system. This includes executable application binaries, library files, and similar artifacts.
