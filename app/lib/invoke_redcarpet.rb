# Invoke the Redcarpet markdown processor with *MAXIMIZED* safety

# We've used redcarpet for years. It's capable, fast, and doesn't
# fragment memory. However, we've recently seen it crash every once in a while
# with this report, which may simply be because we're stressing it more:
# md->work_bufs[BUFFER_SPAN].size == 0
# This issue may be related, it has the error report:
# https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/570

# This failure is rare and we've been unable to replicate it
# at this time. We're open to switching. Commonmarker is really good, but
# when we tried to switch to it, its use led to uncontrolled memory growth
# we couldn't accept. A pure-Ruby solution can't work for us,
# we have to support too many requests.

# We've also occasionally seen this error report:
# NotImplementedError: method 'to_s' called on unexpected
# T_IMEMO object (0x00007fd5c82c83c8 flags=0x8703a)
# app/lib/invoke_redcarpet.rb:245:in 'Redcarpet::Markdown#render'
# The reference to T_IMEMO is surprising; that's a low-level detail that
# simply should never be visible to the test.
# Gemini suggested the following:
# Class variables in Ruby are shared across the inheritance hierarchy
# and persist for the lifetime of the process. In a test environment:
# C-Extension State: The Redcarpet::Markdown object holds a pointer to
# a C-struct representing your RENDERER.
# Memory Reuse: If a test modifies the global state or if the test runner
# (like RSpec or Minitest) interacts with the class in a way that causes
# the Ruby VM to move objects in memory (Compacting GC), a class variable
# pointing to a C-backed object can become "stale."
# The T_IMEMO Connection: The fact that you are seeing a T_IMEMO object
# means that the memory address where the Renderer used to live has been
# reclaimed by the Ruby VM for internal bookkeeping. Because the class
# variable didn't "release" that address, the processor.render call tries
# to execute C-code against an internal VM structure.

# Our earlier efforts to prevent this, by re-creating markdown
# renderers and processors, and using each pair only once.
# Originally I only re-created the markdown processor instance, since
# that's where the original error reports came from, namely
# `md->work_bufs[BUFFER_SPAN].size == 0`.
# The benchmark indicates that if a project section
# needs 50 markdown renders (an unlikely high number for a project),
# instantiating a processor each time adds 50*(0.104432-0.010429)/10000
# = 0.47 milliseconds (0.00047 seconds) in real time for showing a project.
# By itself that didn't eliminate crashes.
# I modified the benchmark to see the overhead of *also* re-creating
# the renderer for each markdown process. If again some project display
# *also* needs 50 markdown renders (an unlikely high number for a project),
# instantiating a markdown processor *and* renderer
# each time adds 50*(0.442712-0.012445)/10000
# = 2.15 milliseconds in real time for showing a project.
# Notice that I'm always using "real" time as the conservative answer.
# Our current "project shows" take around 22msec, so that is a ~10%
# increase in execution time of our most common request type.

# However, creating objects each time we want to process markdown meant
# we had to clean them up later, creating *huge* occasional latencies.
# We created them in batches and put them in a queue, to try to put them
# in a place where we could recover them. All of that extra mechanism
# created huge overhead in efforts to work around bugs in the library.
# We instead fixed the underlying library, sent our fixes upstream, and plan
# to use our forked version until upstream is fixed. As a result, we can
# use the markdown processor in the simple way as intended. Our fixes also
# raise exceptions (instead of crashing) if certain assertions fail; this
# lets us log the problem and recreate objects.
