<%# This is intentionally short and does *NOT* use the standard layout,
    to minimize CPU and bandwidth use during an attack.
    An attacker may create a rediculous number of requests.
    By optimizing this for speed, we have a better chance of keeping
    up and can recover more quickly.  Instead of giving lots of info,
    we report the error and give a link to the home page.
    We *do* use the locale, since we want humans to be able to
    understand this information if there's a human reader.
    We intentionally do *not* parrot back the bad URL. The user can
    already see the URL (using the browser), and returning a known-bad URL
    creates an opportunity for a XSS attack that we don't need to provide.
    Users will never see this page during normal use. -%>
