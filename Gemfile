# This lists all gems we directly depend on.
# We depend on explicit version numbers (so we can control upgrade times).
# Any one gem is listed no more than once (to prevent referring to
# different version numbers in different environments).

# Updating Rails-related gems requires simultaneously updating them.
# You may need to update all of their versions below. Then run this:
# bundle update actionmailer actionpack actionview activejob activemodel \
#        activerecord activesupport railties rails-i18n rails

# NOTE: When updating you may see a spurious message like this:
#   WARN: Unresolved or ambiguous specs during Gem::Specification.reset:
#       stringio (>= 0)
#       Available/installed versions of this gem:
#       - 3.1.7
#       - 3.1.1
#   WARN: Clearing out unresolved specs. Try 'gem cleanup <gem>'
# It's basically spurious. Run `gem cleanup stringio` and move on.

# Gem omniauth-rails_csrf_protection protects omniauth logins and
# provides a proper integration of omniauth with Rails.
# This requires explanation.
# Gem omniauth 1.x series has vulnerability CVE-2015-9284 if GET requests
# are used.
# OmniAuth gem 2.x requires POST requests by default, which is a
# security improvement.
# However, omniAuth 2.x uses Rack's built-in AuthenticityToken class,
# NOT Rails' CSRF system. When using Rails, we need to instead use Rails'
# ActionController::RequestForgeryProtection for CSRF protection.
# For a discussion on this countermeasure see:
# <https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284>.
# At one time I did this:
# gem 'omniauth-rails_csrf_protection',
#    git: 'https://github.com/cookpad/omniauth-rails_csrf_protection.git',
#    ref: 'b33ff2e57f7c0530da76da6b4b358218f1e7f230'
# to provide a stronger guarantee that what I reviewed is what will
# be loaded, by specifying a specific hash reference.
# However, using a git reference busts CI pipeline caching, slowing down
# all testing, and over time we've become more comfortable that this is
# the "standard way to resolve this issue".
