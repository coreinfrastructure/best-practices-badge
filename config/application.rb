    #   5.0: per-form CSRF tokens, origin-header CSRF check, belongs_to required
    #   5.2: AES-256-GCM cookie encryption (rotation in cookies_rotations.rb)
    #   6.0: cookie metadata, modern mail delivery job
    #   6.1: has_many_inversing, SameSite=Lax, jitter on job retries
    #   7.0: SHA-256 key derivation, partial_inserts=false, open-redirect raise
    #   7.1: autoload path isolation, secure-token on initialize
    #   7.2: PostgreSQL date decoding
    #   8.0: Regexp.timeout (ReDoS defense), strict ETag freshness
    #   8.1: YJIT off in dev/test, no JSON HTML-escaping, relative-redirect raise
