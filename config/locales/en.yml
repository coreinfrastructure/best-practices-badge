        The <a href="https://openssf.org">Open Source Security Foundation
        (OpenSSF)</a> Best Practices badge
        is a way for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS)
        projects to show that they follow best practices. Projects
        can voluntarily self-certify, at no cost, by using this
        web application to explain how they follow each best practice.
        The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge is inspired by the many badges
        available to projects on GitHub. Consumers of the badge
        can quickly assess which FLOSS projects are
        following best practices and as a result are more likely
        to produce higher-quality secure software.

        More information on the OpenSSF Best Practices Badging program is
        <a href='https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge'>available
        on GitHub</a>. <a href="/en/project_stats">Project statistics</a>
        and <a href="/en/criteria_stats">criteria statistics</a> are available.
        The <a href="/en/projects">projects page</a> shows participating
        projects and supports queries (e.g., you can see <a href="/en/projects?gteq=100">projects

        This project was formerly known as the
        Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) Best Practices badge.
        and was originally developed under the CII.
        It is now part of the
        <a href="https://openssf.org/">OpenSSF</a>
        <a href="https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers"
        >Best Practices Working Group (WG)</a>.
        The OpenSSF is a foundation of the
        <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation
        (LF)</a>.
        The project was formally renamed from "CII Best Practices badge"
        on 2021-12-24.

        <p>
        To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files
        called cookies on your device. Many websites do this.
        </p>
        <p>
        A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your
        computer (including your mobile device) when you visit the site.
        It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences
        (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences)
        over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering
        them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page
        to another.
        Cookies are a standard part of the HTTP protocol that implements
        the World Wide Web (WWW), and are specified in
        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265">RFC 6265</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        We use first-party "session" cookies whenever you log in.
        By definition, session cookies are designed to expire
        when you exit your browser or log off.
        If you enable "Keep me logged in" (aka "Remember me"),
        we also store information in a first-party "permanent" cookie on your
        browser so that we can automatically log you back in when you
        visit our site even after you exit your browser.
        If you choose to use other sites (such as GitHub) for
        authentication to this site, then that other site will probably
        use cookies (and thus what they do with cookies will also apply).
        Please note that we can't control what other sites do.
        </p>
        <p>
        The cookies we set are only used to support capabilities
        related to this site. Consent can be withdrawn - just
        delete the cookies on your browser. You can control
        and/or delete cookies as you wish.  For details, see <a
        href="https://www.aboutcookies.org">cookies.org</a>.  You can
        delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can
        set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do
        this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences
        every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities
        may not work.
        In particular, logging into this site depends on session cookies
        (on this and many other sites).

        You don't need to complete badge criteria all at once;
        most projects get the badge by identifying and meeting
        missing criteria over time.
        If you think some criteria don't make any sense, cannot figure out
        how to meet some criteria, or have other questions, please contact us.
        Note that not all criteria must be met to get a badge
        (some criteria SHOULD be met or are simply SUGGESTED).
        If you don't want reminders emailed to you,
        simply edit the project entry and turn off email reminders instead.
        However, if you are <i>certain</i> that you want to
        <i>permanently delete</i> this badge entry, please explain below
        why you are permanently deleting it.

          Projects that follow the best practices below can
          voluntarily self-certify and show that they've
          achieved an Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)
          best practices badge.
        details_html: >-
          There is no set of practices that can guarantee that
          software will never have defects or vulnerabilities;
          even formal methods can fail if the specifications or
          assumptions are wrong. Nor is there any set of practices
          that can guarantee that a project will sustain a healthy
          and well-functioning development community. However,
          following best practices can help improve the results
          of projects. For example, some practices enable multi-person
          review before release, which can both help find otherwise
          hard-to-find technical vulnerabilities and help build
          trust and a desire for repeated interaction among developers
          from different companies. To earn a badge, all MUST
          and MUST NOT criteria must be met, all SHOULD criteria
          must be met OR be unmet with justification, <em>and</em>
          all SUGGESTED criteria must be met OR unmet (we want
          them considered at least).
          If you want to enter justification text as a generic comment,
          instead of being a rationale that the situation is acceptable,
          start the text block with '//' followed by a space.

        details_html: >-
          Most projects should ignore this field. Project badge
          entries can always be edited by the badge entry owner
          (creator), BadgeApp administrators, and anyone who can
          commit to the GitHub repository (if it's on GitHub).
          If you want someone else to be able to edit this badge
          entry, and you already have edit rights to this project
          badge entry, you can additional users with edit rights.
          Just enter "+" followed by a comma-separated list of
          integer user ids. Those users will then also be allowed
          to edit this project entry. If you're the owner of the
          badge entry or a BadgeApp administrator, you can remove
          users from this list by entering "-" followed by a comma-separated
          list of integer user ids. We expect that normally only one
          person will edit a particular badge entry at a time.
          This application uses optimistic locking to prevent saving stale
          data if multiple users try to edit a badge entry simultaneously.
          If you have multiple editors, we recommend saving badge entry
          data incrementally and often (that is a wise practice anyway).

        details: >-
          The OSI uses a rigorous approval process to determine
          which licenses are OSS.
      license_location:
        description: >-
          The project MUST post the license(s) of its results
          in a standard location in their source repository.
        details: >-
          One convention is posting the license
          as a top-level file named LICENSE or COPYING, which
          MAY be followed by an extension such as ".txt" or ".md".
          An alternative convention is to have a directory named LICENSES
          containing license file(s); these files are typically named as their
          SPDX license identifier followed by an appropriate file extension,
          as described in the
          <a href="https://reuse.software/spec/">REUSE Specification</a>.
          Note that this criterion is only a requirement
          on the source repository.
          You do NOT need to include the license file when generating
          something from the source code
          (such as an executable, package, or container).
          For example, when generating an R package for the Comprehensive
          R Archive Network (CRAN), follow standard CRAN practice:
          if the license is a standard license, use the standard short
          license specification (to avoid installing yet another copy
          of the text) and list the LICENSE file in an exclusion file
          such as .Rbuildignore. Similarly, when creating a Debian package,
          you may put a link in the copyright file to the license text in
          /usr/share/common-licenses, and exclude the license file from
          the created package
          (e.g., by deleting the file after calling dh_auto_install).
          We encourage including machine-readable
          license information in generated formats where practical.
      documentation_basics:
        description: >-
          The project MUST provide basic documentation for the
          software produced by the project.
        details: >-
          This documentation must be in some media (such as text
          or video) that includes: how to install it, how to start
          it, how to use it (possibly with a tutorial using examples),
          and how to use it securely (e.g., what to do and what
          not to do) if that is an appropriate topic for the software.
          The security documentation need not be long. The project
          MAY use hypertext links to non-project material as documentation.
          If the project does not produce software, choose "not
          applicable" (N/A).
        met_placeholder: >-
          (Optional) What URL(s) are the starting points to for
          documentation?
      documentation_interface:
        description: >-
          The project MUST provide reference documentation that
          describes the external interface (both input and output)
          of the software produced by the project.
        details: >-
          The documentation of an external interface explains
          to an end-user or developer how to use it.  This would
          include its application program interface (API) if the
          software has one. If it is a library, document the major
          classes/types and methods/functions that can be called.
          If it is a web application, define its URL interface
          (often its REST interface). If it is a command-line
          interface, document the parameters and options it supports.
          In many cases it's best if most of this documentation
          is automatically generated, so that this documentation
          stays synchronized with the software as it changes,
          but this isn't required. The project MAY use hypertext
          links to non-project material as documentation. Documentation
          MAY be automatically generated (where practical this
          is often the best way to do so). Documentation of a
          REST interface may be generated using Swagger/OpenAPI.
          Code interface documentation MAY be generated using
          tools such as <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a>
          (JavaScript), <a href="https://esdoc.org/">ESDoc</a>
          (JavaScript), pydoc (Python),
          <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html">devtools</a> (R),
          <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pkgdown/index.html">pkgdown</a> (R),
          and Doxygen (many).  Merely
          having comments in implementation code is not sufficient
          to satisfy this criterion; there needs to be an easy
          way to see the information without reading through all
          the source code. If the project does not produce software,
          choose "not applicable" (N/A).
      sites_https:
        description: >-
          The project sites (website, repository, and download
          URLs) MUST support HTTPS using TLS.
        details: >-
          This requires that the project home page URL and the version
          control repository URL begin with "https:", not "http:".
          You can get free certificates from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's
          Encrypt</a>. Projects MAY implement this criterion using
          (for example) <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/">GitHub
          pages</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2016/12/24/were-bringing-gitlab-pages-to-community-edition/">GitLab
          pages</a>, or <a href="https://sourceforge.net/blog/introducing-https-for-project-websites/">SourceForge
          project pages</a>.
          If you support HTTP, we urge
          you to redirect the HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
      discussion:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have one or more mechanisms for discussion
          (including proposed changes and issues) that are searchable,
          allow messages and topics to be addressed by URL, enable
          new people to participate in some of the discussions,
          and do not require client-side installation of proprietary
          software.
        details: >-
          Examples of acceptable mechanisms include archived mailing
          list(s), GitHub issue and pull request discussions,
          Bugzilla, Mantis, and Trac. Asynchronous discussion
          mechanisms (like IRC) are acceptable if they meet these
          criteria; make sure there is a URL-addressable archiving
          mechanism. Proprietary JavaScript, while discouraged,
          is permitted.
      english:
        description: >-
          The project SHOULD provide documentation in English
          and be able to accept bug reports and comments about
          code in English.
        details: >-
          English is currently the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca">lingua
          franca</a> of computer technology; supporting English
          increases the number of different potential developers
          and reviewers worldwide. A project can meet this criterion
          even if its core developers' primary language is not
          English.
      maintained:
        description: >-
          The project MUST be maintained.
        details: >-
          As a minimum, the project should attempt to respond to
          significant problem and vulnerability reports.
          A project that is actively pursuing a badge is probably maintained.
          All projects and people have limited resources, and typical projects
          must reject some proposed changes, so limited resources and proposal
          rejections do not by themselves indicate an unmaintained project.
          <br><br>
          When a project knows that it will no longer be maintained,
          it should set this criterion to "Unmet" and use the
          appropriate mechanism(s) to indicate to others that
          it is not being maintained.
          For example, use “DEPRECATED” as the first heading of its README,
          add “DEPRECATED” near the beginning of its home page,
          add “DEPRECATED” to the beginning of its code repository
          project description,
          add a <a href="https://unmaintained.tech/">no-maintenance-intended
          badge</a> in its README and/or home page,
          mark it as deprecated in any package repositories (e.g.,
          <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/deprecating-and-undeprecating-packages-or-package-versions">npm deprecate</a>),
          and/or use the code repository's marking system to archive it (e.g.,
          GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.21/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/archiving-a-github-repository">"archive" setting</a>,
          GitLab’s <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/#archiving-a-project">"archived" marking</a>,
          Gerrit's "readonly" status, or
          SourceForge’s "abandoned" project status).

      repo_public:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have a version-controlled source repository
          that is publicly readable and has a URL.
        details: >-
          The URL MAY be the same as the project URL. The project
          MAY use private (non-public) branches in specific cases
          while the change is not publicly released (e.g., for
          fixing a vulnerability before it is revealed to the
          public).
      repo_track:
        description: >-
          The project's source repository MUST track what changes
          were made, who made the changes, and when the changes
          were made.
      repo_interim:
        description: >-
          To enable collaborative review, the project's source
          repository MUST include interim versions for review
          between releases; it MUST NOT include only final releases.
        details: >-
          Projects MAY choose to omit specific interim versions
          from their public source repositories (e.g., ones that
          fix specific non-public security vulnerabilities, may
          never be publicly released, or include material that
          cannot be legally posted and are not in the final release).
      repo_distributed:
        description: >-
          It is SUGGESTED that common distributed version control
          software be used (e.g., git) for the project's source
          repository.
        details: >-
          Git is not specifically required and projects can use
          centralized version control software (such as subversion)
          with justification.
      version_unique:
        description: >-
          The project results MUST have a unique version identifier
          for each release intended to be used by users.
        details: >-
          This MAY be met in a variety of ways including a commit
          IDs (such as git commit id or mercurial changeset id)
          or a version number (including version numbers that
          use semantic versioning or date-based schemes like YYYYMMDD).
      version_semver:
        description: >-
          It is SUGGESTED that the <a href="https://semver.org">Semantic
          Versioning (SemVer)</a> or
          <a href="https://calver.org/" >Calendar Versioning (CalVer)</a>
          version numbering format be used for releases.
          It is SUGGESTED that those who use CalVer
          include a micro level value.
        details: >-
          Projects should generally prefer whatever format is expected
          by their users, e.g., because it is the normal format used by
          their ecosystem. Many ecosystems prefer SemVer, and SemVer is
          generally preferred for application programmer interfaces (APIs)
          and software development kits (SDKs). CalVer tends to be used
          by projects that are large, have an unusually large number of
          independently-developed dependencies, have a constantly-changing
          scope, or are time-sensitive. It is SUGGESTED that those who
          use CalVer include a micro level value, because including
          a micro level supports simultaneously-maintained branches
          whenever that becomes necessary.
          Other version numbering formats
          may be used as version numbers, including git commit IDs or
          mercurial changeset IDs, as long as they uniquely identify
          versions. However, some alternatives (such as git commit IDs)
          can cause problems as release identifiers, because users may
          not be able to easily determine if they are up-to-date. The
          version ID format may be unimportant for identifying software
          releases if all recipients only run the latest version (e.g.,
          it is the code for a single website or internet service that
          is constantly updated via continuous delivery).
      version_tags:
        description: >-
          It is SUGGESTED that projects identify each release
          within their version control system. For example, it
          is SUGGESTED that those using git identify each release
          using git tags.
      release_notes:
        description: >-
          The project MUST provide, in each release, release notes
          that are a human-readable summary of major changes in
          that release to help users determine if they should
          upgrade and what the upgrade impact will be. The release
          notes MUST NOT be the raw output of a version control
          log (e.g., the "git log" command results are not release
          notes). Projects whose results are not intended for
          reuse in multiple locations (such as the software for
          a single website or service) AND employ continuous delivery
          MAY select "N/A".
        details: >-
          The release notes MAY be implemented in a variety of
          ways. Many projects provide them in a file named "NEWS",
          "CHANGELOG", or "ChangeLog", optionally with extensions
          such as ".txt", ".md", or ".html".  Historically the
          term "change log" meant a log of <em>every</em> change,
          but to meet these criteria what is needed is a human-readable
          summary.  The release notes MAY instead be provided
          by version control system mechanisms such as the <a
          href="https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software">GitHub
          Releases workflow</a>.
      release_notes_vulns:
        description: >-
          The release notes MUST identify every publicly known
          run-time vulnerability fixed in this release that already had a CVE
          assignment or similar when the release was created.
          This criterion may be marked as not applicable (N/A)
          if users typically cannot practically update the software
          themselves (e.g., as is often true for kernel updates).
          This criterion applies only to the project results,
          not to its dependencies. If there are no release notes or there
          have been no publicly known vulnerabilities, choose N/A.
        details: >-
          This criterion helps users determine if a given update will
          fix a vulnerability that is publicly known, to help users make
          an informed decision about updating. If users typically
          cannot practically update the software themselves on their
          computers, but must instead depend on one or more intermediaries
          to perform the update (as is often the case for a kernel and
          low-level software that is intertwined with a kernel), the project
          may choose "not applicable" (N/A) instead, since this additional
          information will not be helpful to those users.
          Similarly, a project may choose N/A if all recipients only
          run the latest version (e.g., it is the code for a single
          website or internet service that is constantly updated via
          continuous delivery).
          This criterion only applies to the project results, not its
          dependencies. Listing the vulnerabilities of all transitive
          dependencies of a project becomes unwieldy as dependencies
          increase and vary, and is unnecessary since tools that examine
          and track dependencies can do this in a more scalable way.
      report_process:
        description: >-
          The project MUST provide a process for users to submit
          bug reports (e.g., using an issue tracker or a mailing
          list).
      report_tracker:
        description: >-
          The project SHOULD use an issue tracker for tracking
          individual issues.
        unmet_placeholder: Why is there no issue tracker?
      report_responses:
        description: >-
          The project MUST acknowledge a majority of bug reports
          submitted in the last 2-12 months (inclusive); the response
          need not include a fix.
      enhancement_responses:
        description: >-
          The project SHOULD respond to a majority (&gt;50%) of
          enhancement requests in the last 2-12 months (inclusive).
        details: >-
          The response MAY be 'no' or a discussion about its merits.
          The goal is simply that there be some response to some
          requests, which indicates that the project is still
          alive. For purposes of this criterion, projects need
          not count fake requests (e.g., from spammers or automated
          systems). If a project is no longer making enhancements,
          please select "unmet" and include the URL that makes
          this situation clear to users. If a project tends to
          be overwhelmed by the number of enhancement requests,
          please select "unmet" and explain.
      report_archive:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have a publicly available archive for
          reports and responses for later searching.
      vulnerability_report_process:
        description: >-
          The project MUST publish the process for reporting vulnerabilities
          on the project site.
        details: >-
          Projects hosted on GitHub SHOULD consider
          <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability"
          >enabling privately reporting a security vulnerability</a>.
          Projects on GitLab SHOULD consider using its ability for
          <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability"
          >privately reporting a vulnerability</a>.
          Projects MAY identify a mailing address
          on https://PROJECTSITE/security,
          often in the form security@example.org.
          This vulnerability reporting process MAY be
          the same as its bug reporting process. Vulnerability
          reports MAY always be public, but many projects have
          a private vulnerability reporting mechanism.
      vulnerability_report_private:
        description: >-
          If private vulnerability reports are supported, the
          project MUST include how to send the information in
          a way that is kept private.
        details: >-
          Examples include a private defect report submitted on
          the web using HTTPS (TLS) or an email encrypted using
          OpenPGP. If vulnerability reports are always public
          (so there are never private vulnerability reports),
          choose "not applicable" (N/A).
      vulnerability_report_response:
        description: >-
          The project's initial response time for any vulnerability
          report received in the last 6 months MUST be less than
          or equal to 14 days.
        details: >-
          If there have been no vulnerabilities reported in the
          last 6 months, choose "not applicable" (N/A).
      build:
        description: >-
          If the software produced by the project requires building
          for use, the project MUST provide a working build system
          that can automatically rebuild the software from source
          code.
        details: >-
          A build system determines what actions need to occur
          to rebuild the software (and in what order), and then
          performs those steps. For example, it can invoke a compiler
          to compile the source code. If an executable is created
          from source code, it must be possible to modify the
          project's source code and then generate an updated executable
          with those modifications. If the software produced by
          the project depends on external libraries, the build
          system does <em>not</em> need to build those external
          libraries. If there is no need to build anything to
          use the software after its source code is modified,
          select "not applicable" (N/A).
      build_common_tools:
        description: >-
          It is SUGGESTED that common tools be used for building
          the software.
        details: >-
          For example, Maven, Ant, cmake, the autotools, make,
          rake (Ruby), or
          <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html">devtools</a> (R).
      build_floss_tools:
        description: The project SHOULD be buildable using only
          FLOSS tools.
      test:
        description: >-
          The project MUST use at least one automated test suite
          that is publicly released as FLOSS (this test suite
          may be maintained as a separate FLOSS project).
          The project MUST clearly show or document how to run the
          test suite(s) (e.g., via a continuous integration (CI)
          script or via documentation in files such as BUILD.md, README.md,
          or CONTRIBUTING.md).
        details: >-
          The project MAY use multiple automated test suites (e.g.,
          one that runs quickly, vs. another that is more thorough
          but requires special equipment).
          There are many test frameworks and test support systems available,
          including
          <a href="https://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>
          (web browser automation),
          <a href="https://junit.org">Junit</a> (JVM, Java),
          <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RUnit">RUnit</a> (R),
          <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html">testthat</a> (R).
      test_invocation:
        description: >-
          A test suite SHOULD be invocable in a standard way for
          that language.
        details: For example, "make check", "mvn test", or "rake
          test" (Ruby).
      test_most:
        description: >-
          It is SUGGESTED that the test suite cover most (or ideally
          all) the code branches, input fields, and functionality.
      test_continuous_integration:
        description: >-
          It is SUGGESTED that the project implement continuous
          integration (where new or changed code is frequently
          integrated into a central code repository and automated
          tests are run on the result).
      test_policy:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have a general policy (formal or not)
          that as major new functionality is added to the software
          produced by the project, tests of that functionality
          should be added to an automated test suite.
        details: >-
          As long as a policy is in place, even by word of mouth,
          that says developers should add tests to the automated
          test suite for major new functionality, select "Met."
      tests_are_added:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have evidence that the <a href="#test_policy">test_policy</a>
          for adding tests has been adhered to in the most recent
          major changes to the software produced by the project.
        details: >-
          Major functionality would typically be mentioned in
          the release notes. Perfection is not required, merely
          evidence that tests are typically being added in practice
          to the automated test suite when new major functionality
          is added to the software produced by the project.
      tests_documented_added:
        description: >-
          It is SUGGESTED that this policy on adding tests (see
          <a href="#test_policy">test_policy</a>) be <em>documented</em>
          in the instructions for change proposals.
        details: >-
          However, even an informal rule is acceptable as long
          as the tests are being added in practice.
      warnings:
        description: >-
          The project MUST enable one or more compiler warning
          flags, a "safe" language mode, or use a separate "linter"
          tool to look for code quality errors or common simple
          mistakes, if there is at least one FLOSS tool that can
          implement this criterion in the selected language.
        details: >-
          Examples of compiler warning flags include gcc/clang
          "-Wall". Examples of a "safe" language mode include
          JavaScript "use strict" and perl5's "use warnings".
          A separate "linter" tool is simply a tool that examines
          the source code to look for code quality errors or common
          simple mistakes. These are typically enabled within
          the source code or build instructions.
      warnings_fixed:
        description: The project MUST address warnings.
        details: >-
          These are the warnings identified by the implementation
          of the <a href="#warnings">warnings</a> criterion. The
          project should fix warnings or mark them in the source
          code as false positives. Ideally there would be no warnings,
          but a project MAY accept some warnings (typically less
          than 1 warning per 100 lines or less than 10 warnings).
      warnings_strict:
        description: >-
          It is SUGGESTED that projects be maximally strict with
          warnings in the software produced by the project, where
          practical.
        details: >-
          Some warnings cannot be effectively enabled on some
          projects. What is needed is evidence that the project
          is striving to enable warning flags where it can, so
          that errors are detected early.
      know_secure_design:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have at least one primary developer
          who knows how to design secure software.
          (See ‘details’ for the exact requirements.)
        details: >-
          This requires understanding the following design principles,
          including the 8 principles from <a href="https://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/">Saltzer
          and Schroeder</a>: <ul> <li>economy of mechanism (keep
          the design as simple and small as practical, e.g., by
          adopting sweeping simplifications) <li>fail-safe defaults
          (access decisions should deny by default, and projects'
          installation should be secure by default) <li>complete
          mediation (every access that might be limited must be
          checked for authority and be non-bypassable) <li>open
          design (security mechanisms should not depend on attacker
          ignorance of its design, but instead on more easily
          protected and changed information like keys and passwords)
          <li>separation of privilege (ideally, access to important
          objects should depend on more than one condition, so
          that defeating one protection system won't enable complete
          access. E.G., multi-factor authentication, such as requiring
          both a password and a hardware token, is stronger than
          single-factor authentication) <li>least privilege (processes
          should operate with the least privilege necessary) <li>least
          common mechanism (the design should minimize the mechanisms
          common to more than one user and depended on by all
          users, e.g., directories for temporary files) <li>psychological
          acceptability (the human interface must be designed
          for ease of use - designing for "least astonishment"
          can help) <li>limited attack surface (the attack surface
          - the set of the different points where an attacker
          can try to enter or extract data - should be limited)
          <li>input validation with allowlists (inputs should
          typically be checked to determine if they are valid
          before they are accepted; this validation should use
          allowlists (which only accept known-good values), not
          denylists (which attempt to list known-bad values)).
          </ul> A "primary developer" in a project is anyone who
          is familiar with the project's code base, is comfortable
          making changes to it, and is acknowledged as such by
          most other participants in the project. A primary developer
          would typically make a number of contributions over
          the past year (via code, documentation, or answering
          questions). Developers would typically be considered
          primary developers if they initiated the project (and
          have not left the project more than three years ago),
          have the option of receiving information on a private
          vulnerability reporting channel (if there is one), can
          accept commits on behalf of the project, or perform
          final releases of the project software. If there is
          only one developer, that individual is the primary developer.
          Many books and courses are available to help you understand
          how to develop more secure software and discuss design.
          For example, the <a href="https://openssf.org/edx-courses/">Secure
          Software Development Fundamentals</a> course is a free set
          of three courses that explain how to develop more secure software
          (it's free if you audit it; for an extra fee you can earn a
          certificate to prove you learned the material).
      know_common_errors:
        description: >-
          At least one of the project's primary developers MUST
          know of common kinds of errors that lead to vulnerabilities
          in this kind of software, as well as at least one method
          to counter or mitigate each of them.
        details: >-
          Examples (depending on the type of software) include
          SQL injection, OS injection, classic buffer overflow,
          cross-site scripting, missing authentication, and missing
          authorization. See the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/">CWE/SANS

          Many books and courses are available to help you understand
          how to develop more secure software and discuss common
          implementation errors that lead to vulnerabilities.

      crypto_published:
        description: >-
          The software produced by the project MUST use, by default,
          only cryptographic protocols and algorithms that are
          publicly published and reviewed by experts (if cryptographic
          protocols and algorithms are used).
        details: >-
          These cryptographic criteria do not always apply because
          some software has no need to directly use cryptographic
          capabilities.
      crypto_call:
        description: >-
          If the software produced by the project is an application
          or library, and its primary purpose is not to implement
          cryptography, then it SHOULD only call on software specifically
          designed to implement cryptographic functions; it SHOULD
          NOT re-implement its own.
      crypto_floss:
        description: >-
          All functionality in the software produced by the project
          that depends on cryptography MUST be implementable using
          FLOSS.
        details: >-
          See the <a href="https://opensource.org/osr">Open Standards
          Requirement for Software by the Open Source Initiative</a>.
      crypto_keylength:
        description: >-
          The security mechanisms within the software produced
          by the project MUST use default keylengths that at least
          meet the NIST minimum requirements through the year
          2030 (as stated in 2012). It MUST be possible to configure
          the software so that smaller keylengths are completely
          disabled.
        details: >-
          These minimum bitlengths are: symmetric key 112, factoring
          modulus 2048, discrete logarithm key 224, discrete logarithmic
          group 2048, elliptic curve 224, and hash 224 (password
          hashing is not covered by this bitlength, more information
          on password hashing can be found in the <a href="#crypto_password_storage">crypto_password_storage</a>
          criterion). See <a href="https://www.keylength.com">https://www.keylength.com</a>
          for a comparison of keylength recommendations from various
          organizations. The software MAY allow smaller keylengths

          this allows downgrade attacks, but shorter keylengths
          are sometimes necessary for interoperability).

        description: >-
          The default security mechanisms within the software
          produced by the project MUST NOT depend on broken cryptographic
          algorithms (e.g., MD4, MD5, single DES, RC4, Dual_EC_DRBG),
          or use cipher modes that are inappropriate to the context,
          unless they are necessary to implement an interoperable protocol
          (where the protocol implemented is the most recent version
          of that standard broadly supported by the network ecosystem,
          that ecosystem requires the use of such an algorithm or mode,
          and that ecosystem does not offer any more secure alternative).
          The documentation MUST describe any relevant security risks
          and any known mitigations if these broken algorithms or modes
          are necessary for an interoperable protocol.
        details: >-
          ECB mode is almost never appropriate because
          it reveals identical blocks within the ciphertext as
          demonstrated by the
          <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin/">ECB penguin</a>,
          and CTR mode is often inappropriate because it does not
          perform authentication and causes duplicates if the input state
          is repeated.  In many cases it's best to choose a block cipher
          algorithm mode designed to combine secrecy and authentication,
          e.g., Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and EAX. Projects MAY
          allow users to enable broken mechanisms (e.g., during configuration)
          where necessary for compatibility, but then users know they're doing
          it.

      crypto_password_storage:

          If the software produced by the project causes the storing
          of passwords for authentication of external users, the
          passwords MUST be stored as iterated hashes with a per-user
          salt by using a key stretching (iterated) algorithm
          (e.g., Argon2id, Bcrypt, Scrypt, or PBKDF2). See also
          <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html">OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet</a>).
        details: >-
          This criterion applies only when the software is enforcing
          authentication of users using passwords for external users
          (aka inbound authentication),
          such as server-side
          web applications. It does not apply in cases where the
          software stores passwords for authenticating into other
          systems (aka outbound authentication, e.g.,
          the software implements a client for
          some other system), since at least parts of that software
          must have often access to the unhashed password.

        details: >-
          A cryptographically secure random number generator may

          (CSPRNG) using an algorithm such as Hash_DRBG, HMAC_DRBG,
          CTR_DRBG, Yarrow, or Fortuna. Examples of calls to <em>secure</em>
          random number generators include Java's java.security.SecureRandom

        details: >-
          An even stronger mechanism is releasing the software
          with digitally signed packages, since that mitigates
          attacks on the distribution system, but this only works
          if the users can be confident that the public keys for

      vulnerabilities_fixed_60_days:

          There MUST be no unpatched vulnerabilities of medium
          or higher severity that have been publicly known for more
          than 60 days.
        details: >-
          The vulnerability must be patched and released by the
          project itself (patches may be developed elsewhere).
          A vulnerability becomes publicly known (for this purpose)
          once it has a CVE with publicly released non-paywalled
          information (reported, for example, in the
          <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National
          Vulnerability Database</a>) or when the project has
          been informed and the information has been released
          to the public (possibly by the project).
          A vulnerability is considered medium or higher severity if its <a
          href="https://www.first.org/cvss/"
          >Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)</a>
          base qualitative score is medium or higher.
          In CVSS versions 2.0 through 3.1, this is
          equivalent to a CVSS score of 4.0 or higher.
          Projects may use the CVSS score
          as published in a widely-used vulnerability database (such as the
          <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov">National Vulnerability Database</a>)
          using the most-recent version of CVSS reported in that database.
          Projects may instead calculate the severity
          themselves using the latest version of
          <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/">CVSS</a> at the time of
          the vulnerability disclosure,
          if the calculation inputs are publicly revealed once
          the vulnerability is publicly known.
          <strong>Note</strong>:
          this means that users might be left vulnerable to all
          attackers worldwide for up to 60 days. This criterion
          is often much easier to meet than what Google recommends
          in <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2010/07/rebooting-responsible-disclosure-focus.html">Rebooting
          responsible disclosure</a>, because Google recommends
          that the 60-day period start when the project is notified
          <em>even</em> if the report is not public.
          Also note that this badge criterion, like other criteria,
          applies to the individual project. Some projects are part of
          larger umbrella organizations or larger projects, possibly in
          multiple layers, and many projects feed their results to other
          organizations and projects as part of a potentially-complex
          supply chain. An individual project often cannot control
          the rest, but an individual project can work to release
          a vulnerability patch in a timely way. Therefore, we focus
          solely on the individual project's response time.  Once a patch is
          available from the individual project, others can determine how to
          deal with the patch (e.g., they can update to the newer version or
          they can apply just the patch as a cherry-picked solution).

      static_analysis:

          At least one static code analysis tool (beyond compiler warnings

          to any proposed major production release of the software
          before its release, if there is at least one FLOSS tool
          that implements this criterion in the selected language.
        details: >-
          A static code analysis tool examines the software code
          (as source code, intermediate code, or executable) without
          executing it with specific inputs. For purposes of this
          criterion, compiler warnings and "safe" language modes
          do not count as static code analysis tools (these typically
          avoid deep analysis because speed is vital).
          Some static analysis tools focus on detecting generic defects,
          others focus on finding specific kinds of defects (such as
          vulnerabilities), and some do a combination.
          Examples
          of such static code analysis tools include <a href="http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/">cppcheck</a> (C, C++),

          in the analyzed language or environment.
        details: >-
          Static analysis tools that are specifically designed to look for
          common vulnerabilities are more likely to find them.
          That said, using any static tools will typically help find
          some problems, so we are suggesting but not requiring this for

          be applied to any proposed major production release
          of the software before its release.
        details: >-
          A dynamic analysis tool examines the software by executing
          it with specific inputs. For example, the project MAY
          use a fuzzing tool (e.g., <a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">American
          Fuzzy Lop</a>) or a web application scanner (e.g., <a

          ZAP</a> or <a href="https://w3af.org/">w3af</a>). In
          some cases the <a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz#introduction">OSS-Fuzz</a>
          project may be willing to apply fuzz testing to your
          project. For purposes of this criterion the dynamic
          analysis tool needs to vary the inputs in some way to
          look for various kinds of problems <em>or</em> be an
          automated test suite with at least 80% branch coverage.
          The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_program_analysis">Wikipedia
          page on dynamic analysis</a> and the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fuzzing">OWASP
          page on fuzzing</a> identify some dynamic analysis tools.
          The analysis tool(s) MAY be focused on looking for security

      dynamic_analysis_unsafe:

          It is SUGGESTED that if the software produced by the

          language (e.g., C or C++), then at least one dynamic
          tool (e.g., a fuzzer or web application scanner) be
          routinely used in combination with a mechanism to detect
          memory safety problems such as buffer overwrites. If
          the project does not produce software written in a memory-unsafe
          language, choose "not applicable" (N/A).

      dynamic_analysis_enable_assertions:
        description: >-
          It is SUGGESTED that the project use a configuration for at least
          some dynamic analysis (such as testing or fuzzing) which enables
          many assertions. In many cases these assertions should <i>not</i> be
          enabled in production builds.
        details: >-
          This criterion does <i>not</i> suggest enabling assertions
          during production; that is entirely up to the project and its
          users to decide. This criterion's focus is instead to improve
          fault detection during dynamic analysis <i>before</i> deployment.
          Enabling assertions in <i>production</i> use is <i>completely</i>
          different from enabling assertions during dynamic analysis
          (such as testing).
          In some cases enabling assertions in production use is
          extremely unwise (especially in high-integrity components).
          There are many arguments against
          enabling assertions in production, e.g., libraries should not
          crash callers, their presence may cause rejection by app stores,
          and/or activating an assertion in production may expose private
          data such as private keys.
          Beware that in many Linux distributions <tt>NDEBUG</tt>
          is not defined, so C/C++ <t>assert()</tt> will by default be enabled
          for production in those environments.
          It may be important to use a different assertion mechanism
          or defining <tt>NDEBUG</tt> for production in those environments.

          The project SHOULD have a legal mechanism where all
          developers of non-trivial amounts of project software
          assert that they are legally authorized to make these
          contributions. The most common and easily-implemented
          approach for doing this is by using a <a href="https://developercertificate.org/">Developer
          Certificate of Origin (DCO)</a>, where users add "signed-off-by"
          in their commits and the project links to the DCO website.
          However, this MAY be implemented as a Contributor License
          Agreement (CLA), or other legal mechanism.
        details: >-
          The DCO is the recommended mechanism because it's easy
          to implement, tracked in the source code, and git directly
          supports a "signed-off" feature using "commit -s". To
          be most effective it is best if the project documentation
          explains what "signed-off" means for that project. A
          CLA is a legal agreement that defines the terms under
          which intellectual works have been licensed to an organization
          or project.  A contributor assignment agreement (CAA)
          is a legal agreement that transfers rights in an intellectual
          work to another party; projects are not required to
          have CAAs, since having CAA increases the risk that

          and the corporate CLA)</a> are examples of CLAs, for
          projects which determine that the risks of these kinds
          of CLAs to the project are less than their benefits.
      governance:
        description: >-
          The project MUST clearly define and document its project
          governance model (the way it makes decisions, including
          key roles).
        details: >-
          There needs to be some well-established documented way
          to make decisions and resolve disputes. In small projects,
          this may be as simple as "the project owner and lead
          makes all final decisions". There are various governance
          models, including benevolent dictator and formal meritocracy;
          for more details, see <a href="http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/governancemodels">Governance
          models</a>. Both centralized (e.g., single-maintainer)
          and decentralized (e.g., group maintainers) approaches
          have been successfully used in projects. The governance
          information does not need to document the possibility
          of creating a project fork, since that is always possible
          for FLOSS projects.
      code_of_conduct:
        description: >-
          The project MUST adopt a code of conduct and post it
          in a standard location.
        details: >-
          Projects may be able to improve the civility of their
          community and to set expectations about acceptable conduct
          by adopting a code of conduct. This can help avoid problems
          before they occur and make the project a more welcoming
          place to encourage contributions. This should focus
          only on behavior within the community/workplace of the
          project.  Example codes of conduct are the
          <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/code-of-conduct.html">Linux kernel code of conduct</a>,
          the <a href="https://contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor

      roles_responsibilities:
        description: >-
          The project MUST clearly define and publicly document
          the key roles in the project and their responsibilities,
          including any tasks those roles must perform.  It MUST
          be clear who has which role(s), though this might not
          be documented in the same way.
        details: >-
          The documentation for <a href="#governance">governance</a>
          and roles and responsibilities may be in one place.
      access_continuity:
        description: >-
          The project MUST be able to continue with minimal interruption
          if any one person dies, is incapacitated, or is
          otherwise unable or unwilling to continue support of the project.
          In particular, the project MUST be able to create and close issues,
          accept proposed changes, and release versions of software,
          within a week of confirmation of the loss of support
          from any one individual.
          This MAY be done by ensuring
          someone else has any necessary keys, passwords, and
          legal rights to continue the project. Individuals who
          run a FLOSS project MAY do this by providing keys in
          a lockbox and a will providing any needed legal rights
          (e.g., for DNS names).
      bus_factor:
        description: The project SHOULD have a "bus factor" of
          2 or more.
        details: >-
          A "bus factor" (aka "truck factor") is the minimum number
          of project members that have to suddenly disappear from
          a project ("hit by a bus") before the project stalls
          due to lack of knowledgeable or competent personnel.
          The <a href="https://github.com/mtov/truck-factor">truck-factor</a>
          tool can estimate this for projects on GitHub. For more
          information, see <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272824568_assessing_the_bus_factor_of_git_repositories">Assessing
          the Bus Factor of Git Repositories</a> by Cosentino
          et al.
      documentation_roadmap:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have a documented roadmap that describes
          what the project intends to do and not do for at least
          the next year.
        details: >-
          The project might not achieve the roadmap, and that's
          fine; the purpose of the roadmap is to help potential
          users and constributors understand the intended direction
          of the project. It need not be detailed.
      documentation_architecture:
        description: >-
          The project MUST include documentation of the architecture
          (aka high-level design) of the software produced by
          the project. If the project does not produce software,
          select "not applicable" (N/A).
        details: >-
          A software architecture explains a program's fundamental
          structures, i.e., the program's major components, the
          relationships among them, and the key properties of
          these components and relationships.
      documentation_security:
        description: >-
          The project MUST document what the user can and cannot
          expect in terms of security from the software produced
          by the project (its "security requirements").
        details: >-
          These are the security requirements that the software
          is intended to meet.
      documentation_quick_start:
        description: >-
          The project MUST provide a "quick start" guide for new
          users to help them quickly do something with the software.
        details: >-
          The idea is to show users how to get started and make
          the software do anything at all. This is critically
          important for potential users to get started.
      assurance_case:
        description: >-
          The project MUST provide an assurance case that justifies
          why its security requirements are met. The assurance
          case MUST include: a description of the threat model,
          clear identification of trust boundaries, an argument
          that secure design principles have been applied, and
          an argument that common implementation security weaknesses
          have been countered.
        details: >-
          An assurance case is "a documented body of evidence
          that provides a convincing and valid argument that a
          specified set of critical claims regarding a system’s
          properties are adequately justified for a given application
          in a given environment" (<a
          href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/software-assurance-using-structured-assurance-case-models">"Software
          Assurance Using Structured Assurance Case
          Models", Thomas Rhodes et al, NIST Interagency Report
          7608</a>). Trust boundaries are boundaries where data
          or execution changes its level of trust, e.g., a server's
          boundaries in a typical web application. It's common
          to list secure design principles (such as Saltzer and
          Schroeer) and common implementation security weaknesses
          (such as the OWASP top 10 or CWE/SANS top 25), and show
          how each are countered. The <a href="https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/security.md">BadgeApp
          assurance case</a> may be a useful example. This is
          related to documentation_security, documentation_architecture,
          and implement_secure_design.
      documentation_current:
        description: >-
          The project MUST make an effort to keep the documentation
          consistent with the current version of the project results
          (including software produced by the project). Any <em>known</em>
          documentation defects making it inconsistent MUST be
          fixed. If the documentation is generally current, but
          erroneously includes some older information that is
          no longer true, just treat that as a defect, then track
          and fix as usual.
        details: >-
          The documentation MAY include information about differences
          or changes between versions of the software and/or link
          to older versions of the documentation. The intent of
          this criterion is that an effort is made to keep the
          documentation consistent, not that the documentation
          must be perfect.
      documentation_achievements:
        description: >-
          The project repository front page and/or website MUST
          identify and hyperlink to any achievements, including
          this best practices badge, within 48 hours of public
          recognition that the achievement has been attained.
        details: >-
          An achievement is any set of external criteria that
          the project has specifically worked to meet, including
          some badges. This information does not need to be on
          the project website front page.  A project using GitHub
          can put achievements on the repository front page by
          adding them to the README file.
      accessibility_best_practices:
        description: >-
          The project (both project sites and project results)
          SHOULD follow accessibility best practices so that persons
          with disabilities can still participate in the project
          and use the project results where it is reasonable to
          do so.
        details: |-
          For web applications, see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</a> and its supporting document <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html">Understanding WCAG 2.0</a>; see also <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">W3C accessibility information</a>. For GUI applications, consider using the environment-specific accessibility guidelines (such as <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/accessibility-devel-guide/stable/">Gnome</a>, <a href="https://accessibility.kde.org/">KDE</a>, <a href="https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-settings/accessibility">XFCE</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/">Android</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/accessibility/ios/">iOS</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/voiceover/">Mac</a>, and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/accessibility/accessibility-overview">Windows</a>). Some TUI applications (e.g. `ncurses` programs) can do certain things to make themselves more accessible (such as `alpine`'s `force-arrow-cursor` setting). Most command-line applications are fairly accessible as-is. This criterion is often N/A, e.g., for program libraries. Here are some examples of actions to take or issues to consider: <ul> <li>Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so
            that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as
            large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language (
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv.html">WCAG 2.0 guideline 1.1</a>)
          <li>Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying
            information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
            distinguishing a visual element. (
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html">WCAG 2.0 guideline 1.4.1</a>)
          <li>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast
            ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large text, incidental text,
            and logotypes (
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html">WCAG 2.0 guideline 1.4.3</a>)
          <li>Make all functionality available from a keyboard (WCAG guideline 2.1) <li>A GUI or web-based project SHOULD test with at least one
            screen-reader on the target platform(s) (e.g. NVDA, Jaws, or
            WindowEyes on Windows; VoiceOver on Mac & iOS; Orca on Linux/BSD;
            TalkBack on Android). TUI programs MAY work to reduce overdraw
            to prevent redundant reading by screen-readers.
          </ul>
      internationalization:
        description: >-
          The software produced by the project SHOULD be internationalized
          to enable easy localization for the target audience's
          culture, region, or language. If internationalization
          (i18n) does not apply (e.g., the software doesn't generate
          text intended for end-users and doesn't sort human-readable
          text), select "not applicable" (N/A).
        details: >-
          Localization "refers to the adaptation of a product,
          application or document content to meet the language,
          cultural and other requirements of a specific target
          market (a locale)." Internationalization is the "design
          and development of a product, application or document
          content that enables easy localization for target audiences
          that vary in culture, region, or language." (See <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n">W3C's
          "Localization vs. Internationalization"</a>.) Software
          meets this criterion simply by being internationalized.
          No localization for another specific language is required,
          since once software has been internationalized it's
          possible for others to work on localization.
      sites_password_security:
        description: >-
          If the project sites (website, repository, and download
          URLs) store passwords for authentication of external
          users, the passwords MUST be stored as iterated hashes
          with a per-user salt by using a key stretching (iterated)
          algorithm (e.g., Argon2id, Bcrypt, Scrypt, or PBKDF2). If the project
          sites do not store passwords for this purpose, select
          "not applicable" (N/A).
        details: >-
          Note that the use of <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-security/">GitHub</a>
          meets this criterion. This criterion only applies to
          passwords used for authentication of external users
          into the project sites (aka inbound authentication).
          If the project sites must log
          in to other sites (aka outbound authentication),
          they may need to store authorization
          tokens for that purpose differently (since storing a hash
          would be useless). This
          applies criterion crypto_password_storage to the project
          sites, similar to sites_https.
      maintenance_or_update:
        description: >-
          The project MUST maintain the most often used older
          versions of the product <em>or</em> provide an upgrade
          path to newer versions. If the upgrade path is difficult,
          the project MUST document how to perform the upgrade
          (e.g., the interfaces that have changed and detailed
          suggested steps to help upgrade).
      report_tracker:
        description: >-
          The project MUST use an issue tracker for tracking individual
          issues.
      vulnerability_report_credit:
        description: >-
          The project MUST give credit to the reporter(s) of all
          vulnerability reports resolved in the last 12 months,
          except for the reporter(s) who request anonymity. If
          there have been no vulnerabilities resolved in the last
          12 months, select "not applicable" (N/A).
      vulnerability_response_process:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have a documented process for responding
          to vulnerability reports.
        details: >-
          This is strongly related to vulnerability_report_process,
          which requires that there be a documented way to report
          vulnerabilities. It also related to vulnerability_report_response,
          which requires response to vulnerability reports within
          a certain time frame.
      coding_standards:
        description: >-
          The project MUST identify the specific coding style
          guides for the primary languages it uses, and require
          that contributions generally comply with it.
        details: >-
          In most cases this is done by referring to some existing
          style guide(s), possibly listing differences. These
          style guides can include ways to improve readability
          and ways to reduce the likelihood of defects (including
          vulnerabilities). Many programming languages have one
          or more widely-used style guides. Examples of style
          guides include <a href="https://github.com/google/styleguide">Google's
          style guides</a> and <a href="https://www.securecoding.cert.org/">SEI
          CERT Coding Standards</a>.
      coding_standards_enforced:
        description: >-
          The project MUST automatically enforce its selected
          coding style(s) if there is at least one FLOSS tool
          that can do so in the selected language(s).
        details: >-
          This MAY be implemented using static analysis tool(s)
          and/or by forcing the code through code reformatters.
          In many cases the tool configuration is included in
          the project's repository (since different projects may
          choose different configurations). Projects MAY allow
          style exceptions (and typically will); where exceptions
          occur, they MUST be rare and documented in the code
          at their locations, so that these exceptions can be
          reviewed and so that tools can automatically handle
          them in the future. Examples of such tools include
          ESLint (JavaScript), Rubocop (Ruby), and
          <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html">devtools check</a> (R).
      build_standard_variables:
        description: >-
          Build systems for native binaries MUST honor the relevant
          compiler and linker (environment) variables passed in
          to them (e.g., CC, CFLAGS, CXX, CXXFLAGS, and LDFLAGS)
          and pass them to compiler and linker invocations. A
          build system MAY extend them with additional flags;
          it MUST NOT simply replace provided values with its
          own. If no native binaries are being generated, select
          "not applicable" (N/A).
        details: >-
          It should be easy to enable special build features like
          Address Sanitizer (ASAN), or to comply with distribution
          hardening best practices (e.g., by easily turning on
          compiler flags to do so).
      build_preserve_debug:
        description: >-
          The build and installation system SHOULD preserve debugging
          information if they are requested in the relevant flags
          (e.g., "install -s" is not used). If there is no build
          or installation system (e.g., typical JavaScript libraries),
          select "not applicable" (N/A).
        details: >-
          E.G., setting CFLAGS (C) or CXXFLAGS (C++) should create
          the relevant debugging information if those languages
          are used, and they should not be stripped during installation.
          Debugging information is needed for support and analysis,
          and also useful for measuring the presence of hardening
          features in the compiled binaries.
      build_non_recursive:
        description: >-
          The build system for the software produced by the project
          MUST NOT recursively build subdirectories if there are
          cross-dependencies in the subdirectories. If there is
          no build or installation system (e.g., typical JavaScript
          libraries), select "not applicable" (N/A).
        details: >-
          The project build system's internal dependency information
          needs to be accurate, otherwise, changes to the project
          may not build correctly. Incorrect builds can lead to
          defects (including vulnerabilities). A common mistake
          in large build systems is to use a "recursive build"
          or "recursive make", that is, a hierarchy of subdirectories
          containing source files, where each subdirectory is
          independently built. Unless each subdirectory is fully
          independent, this is a mistake, because the dependency
          information is incorrect.
      build_repeatable:
        description: >-
          The project MUST be able to repeat the process of generating
          information from source files and get exactly the same
          bit-for-bit result. If no building occurs (e.g., scripting
          languages where the source code is used directly instead
          of being compiled), select "not applicable" (N/A).
        details: >-
          GCC and clang users may find the -frandom-seed option
          useful; in some cases, this can be resolved by forcing
          some sort order. More suggestions can be found at the
          <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">reproducible
          build</a> site.
      installation_common:
        description: >-
          The project MUST provide a way to easily install and
          uninstall the software produced by the project using
          a commonly-used convention.
        details: >-
          Examples include using a package manager (at the system
          or language level), "make install/uninstall" (supporting
          DESTDIR), a container in a standard format, or a virtual
          machine image in a standard format. The installation
          and uninstallation process (e.g., its packaging) MAY
          be implemented by a third party as long as it is FLOSS.
      installation_standard_variables:
        description: >-
          The installation system for end-users MUST honor standard
          conventions for selecting the location where built artifacts
          are written to at installation time.  For example, if
          it installs files on a POSIX system it MUST honor the
          DESTDIR environment variable. If there is no installation
          system or no standard convention, select "not applicable"
          (N/A).
      installation_development_quick:
        description: >-
          The project MUST provide a way for potential developers
          to quickly install all the project results and support
          environment necessary to make changes, including the
          tests and test environment. This MUST be performed with
          a commonly-used convention.
        details: >-
          This MAY be implemented using a generated container
          and/or installation script(s). External dependencies
          would typically be installed by invoking system and/or
          language package manager(s), per external_dependencies.
      external_dependencies:
        description: >-
          The project MUST list external dependencies in a computer-processable
          way.
        details: >-
          Typically this is done using the conventions of package
          manager and/or build system. Note that this helps implement
          <a href="#installation_development_quick">installation_development_quick</a>.
      dependency_monitoring:
        description: >-
          Projects MUST monitor or periodically check their external
          dependencies (including convenience copies) to detect
          known vulnerabilities, and fix exploitable vulnerabilities
          or verify them as unexploitable.
        details: >-
          This can be done using an origin analyzer / dependency
          checking tool / software composition analysis tool such as <a
          href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check">OWASP's
          Dependency-Check</a>,
          <a href="https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-auditor">Sonatype's
          Nexus Auditor</a>, <a
          href="https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/security-testing/software-composition-analysis.html">Synopsys'
          Black Duck Software Composition Analysis</a>,
          and <a href="https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit">Bundler-audit
          (for Ruby)</a>. Some package managers include mechanisms
          to do this. It is acceptable if the components' vulnerability
          cannot be exploited, but this analysis is difficult
          and it is sometimes easier to simply update or fix the
          part.
      updateable_reused_components:
        description: |-
          The project MUST either:
          <ol>
          <li> make it easy to identify and update reused externally-maintained components; <strong>or</strong></li>
          <li> use the standard components provided by the system or programming language.</li>
          </ol>
          Then, if a vulnerability is found in a reused component, it will be
          easy to update that component.
        details: >-
          A typical way to meet this criterion is to use system
          and programming language package management systems.
          Many FLOSS programs are distributed with "convenience
          libraries" that are local copies of standard libraries
          (possibly forked). By itself, that's fine. However,
          if the program *must* use these local (forked) copies,
          then updating the "standard" libraries as a security
          update will leave these additional copies still vulnerable.
          This is especially an issue for cloud-based systems;
          if the cloud provider updates their "standard" libaries
          but the program won't use them, then the updates don't
          actually help. See, e.g., <a href="https://spot.livejournal.com/312320.html">"Chromium:
          Why it isn't in Fedora yet as a proper package" by Tom
          Callaway</a>.
      interfaces_current:
        description: >-
          The project SHOULD avoid using deprecated or obsolete
          functions and APIs where FLOSS alternatives are available
          in the set of technology it uses (its "technology stack")
          and to a supermajority of the users the project supports
          (so that users have ready access to the alternative).
      automated_integration_testing:
        description: >-
          An automated test suite MUST be applied on each check-in
          to a shared repository for at least one branch.  This
          test suite MUST produce a report on test success or
          failure.
        details: >-
          This requirement can be viewed as a subset of test_continuous_integration,
          but focused on just testing, without requiring continuous
          integration.
      regression_tests_added50:
        description: >-
          The project MUST add regression tests to an automated
          test suite for at least 50% of the bugs fixed within
          the last six months.
      test_statement_coverage80:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have FLOSS automated test suite(s)
          that provide at least 80% statement coverage if there
          is at least one FLOSS tool that can measure this criterion
          in the selected language.
        details: >-
          Many FLOSS tools are available to measure test coverage,
          including gcov/lcov, Blanket.js, Istanbul, JCov, and
          <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/covr/index.html">covr</a> (R).
          Note that meeting this criterion is not a guarantee
          that the test suite is thorough, instead, failing to
          meet this criterion is a strong indicator of a poor
          test suite.
      test_policy_mandated:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have a formal written policy that as
          major new functionality is added, tests for the new
          functionality MUST be added to an automated test suite.
      tests_documented_added:
        description: >-
          The project MUST include, in its documented instructions
          for change proposals, the policy that tests are to be
          added for major new functionality.
      warnings_strict:
        description: >-
          Projects MUST be maximally strict with warnings in the
          software produced by the project, where practical.
      implement_secure_design:
        description: >-
          The project MUST implement secure design principles
          (from "know_secure_design"), where applicable.  If the
          project is not producing software, select "not applicable"
          (N/A).
        details: >-
          For example, the project results should have fail-safe
          defaults (access decisions should deny by default, and
          projects' installation should be secure by default).
          They should also have complete mediation (every access
          that might be limited must be checked for authority
          and be non-bypassable). Note that in some cases principles
          will conflict, in which case a choice must be made (e.g.,
          many mechanisms can make things more complex, contravening
          "economy of mechanism" / keep it simple).
      crypto_weaknesses:
        description: >-
          The default security mechanisms within the software
          produced by the project MUST NOT depend on cryptographic
          algorithms or modes with known serious weaknesses (e.g.,
          the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm or the CBC mode
          in SSH).
      crypto_algorithm_agility:
        description: >-
          The project SHOULD support multiple cryptographic algorithms,
          so users can quickly switch if one is broken. Common
          symmetric key algorithms include AES, Twofish, and Serpent.
          Common cryptographic hash algorithm alternatives include
          SHA-2 (including SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 AND SHA-512)
          and SHA-3.
      crypto_credential_agility:
        description: >-
          The project MUST support storing authentication credentials
          (such as passwords and dynamic tokens) and private cryptographic
          keys in files that are separate from other information
          (such as configuration files, databases, and logs),
          and permit users to update and replace them without
          code recompilation. If the project never processes authentication
          credentials and private cryptographic keys, select "not
          applicable" (N/A).
      crypto_used_network:
        description: >-
          The software produced by the project SHOULD support
          secure protocols for all of its network communications,
          such as SSHv2 or later, TLS1.2 or later (HTTPS), IPsec,
          SFTP, and SNMPv3. Insecure protocols such as FTP, HTTP,
          telnet, SSLv3 or earlier, and SSHv1 SHOULD be disabled
          by default, and only enabled if the user specifically
          configures it. If the software produced by the project
          does not support network communications, select "not
          applicable" (N/A).
      crypto_tls12:
        description: >-
          The software produced by the project SHOULD, if it supports
          or uses TLS, support at least TLS version 1.2. Note
          that the predecessor of TLS was called SSL. If the software
          does not use TLS, select "not applicable" (N/A).
      crypto_certificate_verification:
        description: >-
          The software produced by the project MUST, if it supports
          TLS, perform TLS certificate verification by default
          when using TLS, including on subresources. If the software
          does not use TLS, select "not applicable" (N/A).
        details: >-
          Note that incorrect TLS certificate verification is
          a common mistake. For more information, see <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/abstracts/ssl-client-bugs.html">"The
          Most Dangerous Code in the World: Validating SSL Certificates
          in Non-Browser Software" by Martin Georgiev et al.</a>

      crypto_verification_private:
        description: >-
          The software produced by the project MUST, if it supports
          TLS, perform certificate verification before sending
          HTTP headers with private information (such as secure
          cookies). If the software does not use TLS, select "not
          applicable" (N/A).
      signed_releases:
        description: >-
          The project MUST cryptographically sign releases of
          the project results intended for widespread use, and
          there MUST be a documented process explaining to users
          how they can obtain the public signing keys and verify
          the signature(s). The private key for these signature(s)
          MUST NOT be on site(s) used to directly distribute the
          software to the public. If releases are not intended
          for widespread use, select "not applicable" (N/A).
        details: >-
          The project results include both source code and any
          generated deliverables where applicable (e.g., executables,
          packages, and containers). Generated deliverables MAY
          be signed separately from source code. These MAY be
          implemented as signed git tags (using cryptographic
          digital signatures). Projects MAY provide generated
          results separately from tools like git, but in those
          cases, the separate results MUST be separately signed.
      version_tags_signed:
        description: >-
          It is SUGGESTED that in the version control system,
          each important version tag (a tag that is part of a
          major release, minor release, or fixes publicly noted
          vulnerabilities) be cryptographically signed and verifiable
          as described in <a href="#signed_releases">signed_releases</a>.
      input_validation:
        description: >-
          The project results MUST check all inputs from potentially
          untrusted sources to ensure they are valid (an *allowlist*),
          and reject invalid inputs, if there are any restrictions
          on the data at all.
        details: >-
          Note that comparing input against a list of "bad formats"
          (aka a *denylist*) is normally not enough, because
          attackers can often work around a denylist. In particular,
          numbers are converted into internal formats and then
          checked if they are between their minimum and maximum
          (inclusive), and text strings are checked to ensure
          that they are valid text patterns (e.g., valid UTF-8,
          length, syntax, etc.). Some data may need to be "anything
          at all" (e.g., a file uploader), but these would typically
          be rare.
      hardening:
        description: >-
          Hardening mechanisms SHOULD be used in the software
          produced by the project so that software defects are
          less likely to result in security vulnerabilities.
        details: >-
          Hardening mechanisms may include HTTP headers like Content
          Security Policy (CSP), compiler flags to mitigate attacks
          (such as -fstack-protector), or compiler flags to eliminate
          undefined behavior. For our purposes least privilege
          is not considered a hardening mechanism (least privilege
          is important, but separate).
      static_analysis_common_vulnerabilities:
        description: >-
          The project MUST use at least one static analysis tool
          with rules or approaches to look for common vulnerabilities
          in the analyzed language or environment, if there is
          at least one FLOSS tool that can implement this criterion
          in the selected language.
      dynamic_analysis_unsafe:
        description: >-
          If the software produced by the project includes software
          written using a memory-unsafe language (e.g., C or C++),
          then at least one dynamic tool (e.g., a fuzzer or web
          application scanner) MUST be routinely used in combination
          with a mechanism to detect memory safety problems such
          as buffer overwrites. If the project does not produce
          software written in a memory-unsafe language, choose
          "not applicable" (N/A).

          or more.
      contributors_unassociated:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have at least two unassociated significant
          contributors.
        details: >-
          Contributors are associated if they are paid to work
          by the same organization (as an employee or contractor)
          and the organization stands to benefit from the project's
          results. Financial grants do not count as being from
          the same organization if they pass through other organizations
          (e.g., science grants paid to different organizations
          from a common government or NGO source do not cause
          contributors to be associated). Someone is a significant
          contributor if they have made non-trivial contributions
          to the project in the past year. Examples of good indicators
          of a significant contributor are: written at least 1,000
          lines of code, contributed 50 commits, or contributed
          at least 20 pages of documentation.
      copyright_per_file:
        description: >-
          The project MUST include a copyright statement in each
          source file, identifying the copyright holder
          (e.g., the [project name] contributors).
        details: >-
          This MAY be done by including the following inside a
          comment near the beginning of each file: "<tt>Copyright
          the [project name] contributors.</tt>". See <a

      license_per_file:
        description: >-
          The project MUST include a license statement in each
          source file. This MAY be done by including the following
          inside a comment near the beginning of each file: <a
          href="https://spdx.dev/ids/#how"><tt>SPDX-License-Identifier:
          [SPDX license expression for project]</tt></a>.
        details: >-
          This MAY also be done by including a statement in natural
          language identifying the license. The project MAY also
          include a stable URL pointing to the license text, or
          the full license text. Note that the criterion license_location
          requires the project license be in a standard location.
          See <a href="https://github.com/david-a-wheeler/spdx-tutorial">this
          SPDX tutorial</a> for more information about SPDX license
          expressions. Note the relationship with <a href="#copyright_per_file">copyright_per_file</a>,
          whose content would typically precede the license information.
      repo_distributed:
        description: >-
          The project's source repository MUST use a common distributed
          version control software (e.g., git or mercurial).
      small_tasks:
        description: >-
          The project MUST clearly identify small tasks that can
          be performed by new or casual contributors.
        details: >-
          This identification is typically done by marking selected
          issues in an issue tracker with one or more tags the
          project uses for the purpose, e.g., <a href="https://up-for-grabs.net/#/">up-for-grabs</a>,
          <a href="https://www.firsttimersonly.com/">first-timers-only</a>,
          "Small fix", microtask, or IdealFirstBug. These new
          tasks need not involve adding functionality; they can
          be improving documentation, adding test cases, or anything
          else that aids the project and helps the contributor
          understand more about the project.
      require_2FA:
        description: >-
          The project MUST require two-factor authentication (2FA)
          for developers for changing a central repository or
          accessing sensitive data (such as private vulnerability
          reports). This 2FA mechanism MAY use mechanisms without
          cryptographic mechanisms such as SMS, though that is
          not recommended.
      secure_2FA:
        description: >-
          The project's two-factor authentication (2FA) SHOULD
          use cryptographic mechanisms to prevent impersonation.
          Short Message Service (SMS) based 2FA, by itself, does
          NOT meet this criterion, since it is not encrypted.
        details: >-
          A 2FA mechanism that meets this criterion would be a
          Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) application that
          automatically generates an authentication code that
          changes after a certain period of time. Note that <a
          href="https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication-via-a-totp-mobile-app/">GitHub
          supports TOTP</a>.
      code_review_standards:
        description: >-
          The project MUST document its code review requirements,
          including how code review is conducted, what must be
          checked, and what is required to be acceptable.

          and contribution_requirements.
      two_person_review:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have at least 50% of all proposed modifications
          reviewed before release by a person other than the author,
          to determine if it is a worthwhile modification and
          free of known issues which would argue against its inclusion
      build_reproducible:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have a <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">reproducible
          build</a>. If no building occurs (e.g., scripting languages
          where the source code is used directly instead of being
          compiled), select "not applicable" (N/A).
        details: >-
          A reproducible build means that multiple parties can
          independently redo the process of generating information
          from source files and get exactly the same bit-for-bit
          result.  In some cases, this can be resolved by forcing
          some sort order. JavaScript developers may consider
          using npm shrinkwrap and webpack OccurenceOrderPlugin.
          GCC and clang users may find the -frandom-seed option
          useful. The build environment (including the toolset)
          can often be defined for external parties by specifying
          the cryptographic hash of a specific container or virtual
          machine that they can use for rebuilding. The <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/">reproducible
          builds project has documentation on how to do this</a>.

          A test suite MUST be invocable in a standard way for
          that language.
      test_continuous_integration:
        description: >-
          The project MUST implement continuous integration, where
          new or changed code is frequently integrated into a
          central code repository and automated tests are run
          on the result.
        details: >-
          In most cases this means that each developer who works
          full-time on the project integrates at least daily.
      test_statement_coverage90:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have FLOSS automated test suite(s)
          that provide at least 90% statement coverage if there
          is at least one FLOSS tool that can measure this criterion
          in the selected language.
      test_branch_coverage80:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have FLOSS automated test suite(s)

          at least one FLOSS tool that can measure this criterion
          in the selected language.
      crypto_used_network:
        description: >-
          The software produced by the project MUST support secure
          protocols for all of its network communications, such
          as SSHv2 or later, TLS1.2 or later (HTTPS), IPsec, SFTP,
          and SNMPv3. Insecure protocols such as FTP, HTTP, telnet,
          SSLv3 or earlier, and SSHv1 MUST be disabled by default,
          and only enabled if the user specifically configures
          it. If the software produced by the project does not
          support network communications, select "not applicable"
          (N/A).
      crypto_tls12:
        description: >-
          The software produced by the project MUST, if it supports
          or uses TLS, support at least TLS version 1.2. Note
          that the predecessor of TLS was called SSL. If the software
          does not use TLS, select "not applicable" (N/A).
      hardened_site:
        description: >-
          The project website, repository (if accessible via the
          web), and download site (if separate) MUST include key
          hardening headers with nonpermissive values.
        details: >-
          Note that GitHub and GitLab are known to meet this. Sites such as
          https://securityheaders.com/ can quickly check this.
          The key hardening headers are: Content Security Policy (CSP),
          HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), X-Content-Type-Options
          (as "nosniff"), and X-Frame-Options.
          Fully static web sites with no ability to log in via the web pages
          could omit some hardening headers with less risk,
          but there's no reliable way to detect such sites,
          so we require these headers even if they are fully static sites.
      security_review:
        description: >-
          The project MUST have performed a security review within
          the last 5 years. This review MUST consider the security
          requirements and security boundary.
        details: >-
          This MAY be done by the project members and/or an independent
          evaluation. This evaluation MAY be supported by static
          and dynamic analysis tools, but there also must be human
          review to identify problems (particularly in design)
          that tools cannot detect.
      hardening:
        description: >-
          Hardening mechanisms MUST be used in the software produced
          by the project so that software defects are less likely
          to result in security vulnerabilities.
      dynamic_analysis:
        description: >-
          The project MUST apply at least one dynamic analysis
          tool to any proposed major production release of the
          software produced by the project before its release.
      dynamic_analysis_enable_assertions:
        description: >-

      There is no set of practices that can <i>guarantee</i> that software
      will never have defects or vulnerabilities.
      Even formal methods can fail if the
      specifications or assumptions are wrong.
      Nor is there any set of practices that can guarantee that a project will
      sustain a healthy and well-functioning development community.</p>
    intro_p03_html:  >-
      <p>
      However, following best practices can help improve the results
      of projects.
      For example, some practices enable multi-person review before release,
      which can both help find otherwise hard-to-find technical vulnerabilities
      and help build trust and a desire for repeated interaction among
      developers from different organizations.</p>
    intro_p04_html:  >-
      <p>
      This page discusses the set of best practices
      for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects
      developed for the
      Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices badge.
      Projects that follow these best practices
      will be able to voluntarily self-certify and show that they've
      achieved the relevant badge.
      Projects can do this, at no cost,
      by using a web application (BadgeApp)
      to explain how they meet these practices and their detailed criteria.</p>
    intro_p05_html:  >-
      <p>
      These best practices have been created to:</p>
    intro_p06_html:  >-
      <ol>
      <li>encourage projects to follow best practices,</li>
      <li>help new projects discover what those practices are, and</li>
      <li>help users know which projects are following best practices
      (so users can prefer such projects).</li>
      </ol>
    intro_p07_html:  >-
      <p>
      The idiom "best practices" means
      "a procedure or set of procedures that is preferred or considered
      standard within an organization, industry, etc."
      (source:
      <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/best-practice"
      rel="nofollow">Dictionary.com</a>).
      These criteria are what we believe are
      widely "preferred or considered standard"
      in the wider FLOSS community.</p>

      <h2 id='criteria_structure'>Criteria Structure</h2>
    structure_p02_html:  >-
      <p>
      The best practices criteria are divided into three levels:<ul>
      <li><b>Passing</b> focuses on best practices
      that well-run FLOSS projects typically already follow.
      Getting the passing badge is an achievement; at any one time
      only about 10% of projects pursuing a badge achieve the passing level.
      <li><b>Silver</b> is a more stringent set of criteria than passing but is
      expected to be achievable by small and single-organization projects.
      <li><b>Gold</b> is even more stringent than silver and includes
      criteria that are not achievable by small or single-organization projects.
      </ul>
    structure_p03_html:  >-

      Every criterion has a short name, shown as superscripted

      The Linux Foundation also sponsors the

      rel="nofollow">OpenChain Project</a>, which
      identifies criteria for a "high quality Free
      and Open Source Software (FOSS) compliance program."
      OpenChain focuses on how organizations can best use FLOSS and contribute
      back to FLOSS projects, while the OpenSSF Best Practices badge
      focuses on the FLOSS projects themselves.
      The OpenSSF Best Practices badge and OpenChain work together to help
      improve FLOSS and how FLOSS is used.</p>

    keywords_p02_html:  >-
      <p>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
      in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119" rel="nofollow">RFC 2119</a>.
      The additional term SUGGESTED is added.
      In summary, these key words have the following meanings:</p>
    keywords_p03_html:  >-
      <ul>
      <li>The term MUST is an absolute requirement, and MUST NOT
      is an absolute prohibition.</li>
    keywords_p04_html:  >-
      <li>The term SHOULD indicates a criterion that is normally required,
      but there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances
      to ignore it.
      However, the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed
      before choosing a different course.</li>
    keywords_p05_html:  >-
      <li>The term SUGGESTED is used instead of SHOULD when the criterion must
      be considered, but the valid reasons
      to not do so are even more common than for SHOULD.</li>
    keywords_p06_html:  >-
      <li>The term MAY provides one way something can be done, e.g.,
      to make it clear that the described implementation is acceptable.</li>
      </ul>
    keywords_p07_html:  >-
      <p>
      Often a criterion is stated as something that SHOULD be done, or is
      SUGGESTED, because it may be difficult to implement or the costs
      to do so may be high.</p>

      <h2 id='criteria_achieving_badge'>Achieving a badge</h2>
    achieving_p02_html:  >-
      <p>
      To obtain a badge, all MUST and MUST NOT criteria must be met, all
      SHOULD criteria must be either met OR unmet with justification, and
      all SUGGESTED criteria have to be considered (it must be
      rated as met or unmet, but justification is not required
      unless noted otherwise).
      An answer of N/A ("not applicable"), where allowed, is considered
      the same as being met.
      In some cases, especially in the higher levels,
      justification and/or a URL may be required.</p>
    achieving_p03_html:  >-
      <p>
      Some criteria have special markings that influence this:<ul>
      <li><b>{N/A allowed}</b> - "N/A" ("Not applicable") is allowed.
      <li><b>{N/A justification}</b> - "N/A" ("Not applicable") is allowed
      and requires justification.
      <li><b>{Met justification}</b> - "Met" requires justification.
      <li><b>{Met URL}</b> - "Met" requires justification with a URL.
      <li><b>{Future}</b> - the answer to this criterion currently
      has no effect, but it may be required in the future.
      </ul>
    achieving_p04_html:  >-
      <p>
      A project must achieve the previous level to achieve the next level.
      In some cases SHOULD criteria become MUST in higher level badges,
      and some SUGGESTED criteria at lower levels become SHOULD or MUST
      in higher level badges. The higher levels also require more
      justification, because we want others to understand <i>how</i>
      the criteria are being met.</p>

      The (many) cryptographic criteria do not always apply, because some

    terminology_p03_html:  >-
      <p>Here are a few key terms:</p><ul>
    terminology_p04_html:  >-
      <li>A <em>project</em> is an active entity that has
      project member(s) and produces project result(s).
      Its member(s) use project sites to coordinate and disseminate result(s).
      A project does not need to be a formal legal entity.</li>
    terminology_p05_html:  >-
      <li>Project <em>members</em> are the
      group of one or more people or companies who work together
      to attempt to produce project results.
      Some FLOSS projects may have different kinds of members, with different
      roles, but that's outside our scope.</li>
    terminology_p06_html:  >-
      <li>Project <em>results</em> are what the project members work together
      to produce as their end goal. Normally this is software,
      but project results may include other things as well.
      Criteria that refer to "software produced by the project"
      are referring to project results.</li>
    terminology_p07_html:  >-
      <li>Project <em>sites</em>
      are the sites dedicated to supporting the development
      and dissemination of project results, and include
      the project website, repository, and download sites where applicable
      (see <a href="#sites_https">sites_https</a>).</li>
    terminology_p08_html:  >-
      <li>The project <em>website</em>, aka project homepage, is the main page
      on the world wide web (WWW) that a new user would typically visit to see
      information about the project; it may be the same as the project's
      repository site (this is often true on GitHub).</li>
    terminology_p09_html:  >-
      <li>The project <em>repository</em> manages and stores the project results
      and revision history of the project results.
      This is also referred to as the project <em>source repository</em>,
      because we only require managing and storing of the editable versions,
      not of automatically generated results
      (in many cases generated results are not stored in a repository).</li>

      The criteria:<ul>
    noncriteria_p03_html:  >-
      <li>do <em>not</em> require any specific technology, product, or service.
      For example, they do <em>not</em> require git, GitHub, or GitLab.
      The criteria <em>do</em> provide guidance and help for common cases,
      since that information can help people understand and meet the criteria.
      There is some special automation for projects using git or GitHub,
      to help users in those common cases, but they are not <em>required</em>.
      Thus, as new tools and capabilities become available,
      projects can quickly switch to them.
      As exceptions, the criteria do require a project web page and TLS.
    noncriteria_p04_html:  >-
      <li>do <em>not</em> require or forbid any
      particular programming language.
      They do require that additional measures be taken for certain
      <em>kinds</em> of programming languages, but that is different.
    noncriteria_p05_html:  >-
      <li><em>never</em> require the use of proprietary software, proprietary
      service, or a proprietary technology, since many <a
      href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html"
      rel="nofollow">free software</a> developers would reject such criteria.
      Projects are <em>allowed</em> to use them and depend on them.
    noncriteria_p06_html:  >-
      <li>do <em>not</em> require active development or
      user discussion within a project.  Some highly mature projects
      rarely change and thus may have little activity.  The criteria
      <em>do</em>, however, require that the project be responsive if
      vulnerabilities are reported to the project.
    noncriteria_p07_html:  >-
      <li>do <em>not</em> require fees to get a badge.
    noncriteria_p08_html:  >-

    noncriteria_p09_html:  >-
      <p>
      The passing level does not include criteria that would be
      impractical for a single-person project, e.g., something that requires
      a significant amount of money.
      Many FLOSS projects are small, and we do not want to disenfranchise them.

      Our application gives every project entry a unique id, but

      project "front page" URL.
      We rate limit changes to the repo URL to prevent some nonsense.

      identifies three general reasons for badging systems (all are
      valid for this):</p><ol>
    criteria_why_p03_html:  >-
      <li>Badges as a motivator of behavior.  We hope that by identifying
      best practices, we'll encourage projects to implement those
      best practices if they do not do them already.</li>
    criteria_why_p04_html:  >-
      <li>Badges as a pedagogical tool.  Some projects may not be aware
      of some of the best practices applied by others,
      or how they can be practically applied.
      The badge will help them become aware of them
      and ways to implement them.</li>
    criteria_why_p05_html:  >-
      <li>Badges as a signifier or credential.
      Potential users want to use projects that are applying best
      practices to consistently produce good results; badges make it easy
      for projects to signify that they are following best practices,
      and make it easy for users to see which projects are doing so.</li>
      </ol>
    self_certification_p01_html:  >-
      <h3 id="criteria_self_certification">Why self-certification?</h3>
    self_certification_p02_html:  >-
      <p>
      We have chosen to use self-certification, because this makes it
      possible for a large number of projects (even small ones) to
      participate.  There are millions of FLOSS projects, and
      paying third parties to independently evaluate each one does not scale.
      There's a risk that projects may make false claims,
      but we think the risk is small, users can check
      the claims for themselves, and false claims can be overridden.
      We also use automation to override false claims where we can be
      confident in the results.
