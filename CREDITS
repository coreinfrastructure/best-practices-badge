(Apologies in advance for anyone we've accidentally omitted.)

Those marked with a "*" have all the necessary rights to
create and close issues, accept proposed changes,
and release versions of software, as well administrate the production system.
This is enough to meet the "access_continuity" criterion.

We currently don't have any security vulnerabilities that have been
found externally by others. If someone *has* done so, and would like to
be credited, we will gladly do so! If we've accidentally forgotten to give
you credit, our apologies; please let us know so we can quickly fix that.
We *want* people to report any vulnerabilities our system has, so that
we can quickly fix them. Please see our information on
[how_to_report_vulnerabilities](CONTRIBUTING.md#how_to_report_vulnerabilities).

Karl Fogel not only provided us helpful inputs, but his book
"Producing Open Secure Software" <http://producingoss.com/>
was an important basis for identifying many project best practices - thank you!
