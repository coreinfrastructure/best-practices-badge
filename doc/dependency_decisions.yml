      which is (BSD-2-Clause OR Ruby). json 1.8.3's repository is at https://github.com/flori/json/tree/master
      and according to https://github.com/flori/json/blob/master/COPYING this is (GPL-2.0
      OR Ruby). This is clearly GPL-2.0 compatible.

      (see COPYING for details) or the {Ruby software license}[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/LICENSE.txt]
      by James Edward Gray II and Greg Brown. The current Ruby license is (BSD-2-Clause
      OR Ruby), which is compatible with everything.  The unusual way the Ruby software
      license is referenced could intend to permit the old license, but the old license
      is (GPL-2.0 OR Ruby), which is still clearly compatible with GPL-2.0 and I am
      unaware of any other incompatibilities.  Besides, it is unlikely the old one
      is meant. On 2015-12-17 the last merged change was 3 days earlier, so this is
      clearly an active project, suggesting that the current Ruby license is the one
      that is accepted.
