# Roadmap

The OpenSSF Best Practices badge project is essentially in a
"sustainment" mode.  That doesn't mean the project is static,
it just means that we've already achieved our "big" objectives.
This is similar to the situation of the Linux kernel, which is
not static either but has also achieved its original key goals.

In particular, we've met our original key objectives:

* created a set of tiered criteria (starting with 1 level),
* a website so people can fill in those criteria and receive a badge
* automation to help fill in some information
* internationalization

## Handle pull requests and issues

At this point, we are primarily driven by specific pull requests and
issues, which have to be prioritized.

Since pull requests take much less time for us to process (in general),
and represent a more significant investment of time by the proposer
(so at least the proposer considers them important), they will tend to
be much more likely to be accepted.

Issues marked as "next" are also considered higher priority.

## General changes to expect in the future

The following are general goals in the 1-2 year horizon:

* Continue to let others know about the badging program
* Encourage projects to get & display a badge and/or pursue higher levels
* Add more automation for filling in projects
* Add more locales
* Update the criteria annually as more is learned
* Reduce monthly hosting costs (without hurting user experience)

The timeframe for many of these will depend on how much other people
provide support for them (this is especially true for adding new locales).
