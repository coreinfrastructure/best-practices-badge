# Code of Conduct

Your code and ideas behind it will be carefully reviewed, often resulting
in critique and criticism.  The review will almost always require
improvements to the code before it can be included in the project.
Know that this happens because everyone involved wants to see the best
possible solution for the overall success of the project.  We do not
want to do anything to cause the quality of submission and eventual
result to ever decrease.

If however, anyone feels personally abused, threatened, or otherwise
uncomfortable due to this process, that is not acceptable.  If so,
please contact the Linux Foundation's Technical Advisory Board at
<tab@lists.linux-foundation.org>, or the individual members, and they
will work to resolve the issue to the best of their ability.  For more
information on who is on the Technical Advisory Board and what their
role is, please see:
<http://www.linuxfoundation.org/programs/advisory-councils/tab>

As a reviewer of code, please strive to keep things civil and focused on
the technical issues involved.  We are all humans, and frustrations can
be high on both sides of the process.  Try to keep in mind the immortal
words of Bill and Ted, "Be excellent to each other."

This is based on the Linux kernel "Code of Conduct",
