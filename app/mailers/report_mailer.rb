# This mailer is for reports from the badge system about projects,
# individually or collectively.  This includes reports about
# badge status changes, summary reports, reminders that a project
# isn't done, etc.  This does not include email to a user
# regarding that user's account; those are handled by UserMailer.

# When sending emails we use I18n.with_locale do..end.
# If the destination is user.email, use:
# ... I18n.with_locale(user.preferred_locale.to_sym) do
# If the destination is REPORT_EMAIL_DESTINATION, use:
# ... I18n.with_locale(I18n.default_locale) do
# That's because it's possible that the current user is an administrator
# or script, in which case the current I18n.locale is not necessarily
# the recipient's preferred_locale.  Where possible, we want to use
# the recipient's preferred_locale when sending an email.

# We have not internationalized debug/monthly reports, since they are
# only sent in one language anyway (translators have enough work to do,
# let's not ask them to translate unused text!).
