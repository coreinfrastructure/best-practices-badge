This is a draft of proposed basic best practices
for open source software (OSS) projects.
OSS projects that follow these best practices
will be able to voluntarily self-certify and show that they've
achieved a Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) badge.
We plan to improve the page design later; for now, please focus on
the criteria and how they're combined.
</p>
<%= render(partial: "details", locals: {is_disabled: false,
           criteria: "badge_intro", details: %{
<p>
There is no set of practices that can guarantee that software
will never have defects or vulnerabilities.
However, following best practices can help improve the results
of OSS projects.
</p>
<p>
To earn a badge the current rules are:
<ul>
<li>all MUST and MUST NOT criteria must be met,
<li>all SHOULD criteria must be met OR be unmet with justification, <i>and</i>
<li>all SUGGESTED criteria must be met OR unmet (we want them considered at least)
</ul>
</p>

Feedback is welcome via the
<a href="https://github.com/linuxfoundation/cii-best-practices-badge">GitHub site as issues or pull requests</a>
There is also a
<a href="https://lists.coreinfrastructure.org/mailman/listinfo/cii-badges">mailing list for general discussion</a>.

The software MUST be released as OSS.},

<p>
For our purposes, this means that the license MUST be at least one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">an approved license by the Open Source Initiative (OSI)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">a free license as approved by the Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/">a free license acceptable to Debian main</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main?rd=Licensing">a "good" license according to Fedora</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The software MAY also be licensed other ways (e.g., "GPLv2 or proprietary" is acceptable).</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: We intend for the automated tool to focus on identifying common OSS licenses such as:     <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>, <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a>, <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause">BSD 2-clause</a>, <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">BSD 3-clause revised</a>, <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0">Apache 2.0</a>, <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license">Lesser GNU General Public License (LGPL)</a>, and the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>.</p>
<p><em>Rationale</em>: These criteria are designed for OSS projects, so we need to ensure that they're only used where they apply.  Some projects are thought of as OSS yet are not actually released as OSS (e.g., they might not have any license, in which case the defaults of the country's legal system apply, or they might use a non-OSS license).  Unusual licenses can cause long-term problems for OSS projects and are more difficult for tools to handle.  We expect that more advanced badges would set a higher bar (e.g., that it <em>must</em> be released under an OSI-approved license).</p>

This requires understanding the following design principles, including the 8 principles from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/">Saltzer and Schroeder</a>:
<ul>
<li>economy of mechanism (keep the design as simple and small as practical, e.g., by adopting sweeping simplifications)
<li>fail-safe defaults (access decisions should deny by default)
<li>complete mediation (every access that might be limited must be checked for authority and be non-bypassable)
<li>open design (security mechanisms should not depend on attacker ignorance of its design, but instead on more easily protected and changed information like keys and passwords)
<li>separation of privilege (multi-factor authentication, such as requiring both a password and a hardware token, is stronger than single-factor authentication)
<li>least privilege (processes should operate with the least privilege necesssary)
<li>least common mechanism (the design should minimize the mechanisms common to more than one user and depended on by all users, e.g., directories for temporary files)
<li>psychological acceptability (the human interface must be designed for ease of use - designing for "least astonishment" can help)
<li>limited attack surface (the attack surface - the set of the different points where an attacker can try to enter or extract data - should be limited)
<li>input validation with whitelists (inputs should typically be checked to determine if they are valid before they are accepted; this validation should use whitelists (which only accept known-good values),
not blacklists (which attempt to list known-bad values))

A static code analysis tool examines
the software code (as source code, intermediate code, or executable) without executing it

speed is vital).
Examples of such static code analysis tools include <a href="http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/">cppcheck</a>, <a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/">clang static analyzer</a>, <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/">FindBugs</a> (including <a href="https://h3xstream.github.io/find-sec-bugs/">FindSecurityBugs</a>), <a href="https://pmd.github.io/">PMD</a>, <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/">Brakeman</a>, <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/">Coverity Quality Analyzer</a>, and <a href="http://www8.hp.com/au/en/software-solutions/static-code-analysis-sast/">HP Fortify Static Code Analyzer</a>.

A dynamic analysis tool examines the software

For example, the project MAY use a fuzzing tool (e.g., <a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">American Fuzzy Lop</a>) or a web application scanner (e.g., <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project">OWASP ZAP</a> or <a href="http://w3af.org/"><a href="(https://w3af.org/)">w3af</a></a>).
