<%# Include unsubscribe link for email notifications.
    The use of unsubscribe_notice_html may look like an XSS vulnerability,
    but it isn't. The use of "_html" means that the returned result
    will be a SafeBuffer ("already escaped string"), instead of a String.
    As a result, it won't be escaped further, but that is correct.
    The "@unsubscribe_url" is expected to be generated by Rails using
    url_for, which *already* escapes all parameters (including the
    email address). Since the URL is already properly encoded, and the
    rest of the text includes HTML commands, we must *not* encode it again. %>
