# Enable dependabot, a tool to automatically propose dependency updates

# It's possible to enable dependabot via just GitHub project settings,
# and we did that for a while. However, when a project does that,
# it's harder for others (such as OpenSSF Scorecard) to realize or verify
# that the project has dependabot enabled. Creating this dependabot.yml
# file makes easier to *verify* that automatic dependency update proposals
# are happening. This also gives finer-grained control.

# For more information, see:

  # Packaged Ruby libraries are called "gems".
  # Bundler tracks gem inter-dependencies and loads gems from external sites
  # (typically from the Rubygems site),
  # Bundler uses the Ruby program 'gem' to install gems locally.
