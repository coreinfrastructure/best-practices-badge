# Contributing

<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: (MIT OR CC-BY-3.0+) -->

Feedback and contributions are very welcome!

Here's help on how to make contributions, divided into the following sections:

* general information,
* vulnerability reporting,
* documentation changes,
* code changes,
* how to check proposed changes before submitting them,
* reuse (supply chain for third-party components, including updating them), and
* keeping up with external changes.

## General information

For specific proposals, please provide them as
[pull requests](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/pulls)
or
[issues](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/issues)
via our
[GitHub site](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge).
For general discussion, feel free to use the
[cii-badges mailing list](https://lists.coreinfrastructure.org/mailman/listinfo/cii-badges).

If you want to propose or discuss changes to the criteria,
the first step is proposing changes to the criteria text,
which is in the file [criteria.md](doc/criteria.md).
The "doc/" directory has information you may find helpful,
including [other.md](doc/other.md) and [background.md](doc/background.md).

The [INSTALL.md](doc/INSTALL.md) file explains how to install the program
locally (highly recommended if you're going to make code changes).
It also provides a quick start guide.

If you're new to the project (or FLOSS in general), the
[Up-for-grabs](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/labels/up-for-grabs)
issues are smaller tasks that may typically take 1-3 days.
You are welcome aboard!
The [roadmap.md](doc/roadmap.md) file provides an overview of future plans.

### Pull requests and different branches recommended

Pull requests are preferred, since they are specific.
For more about how to create a pull request, see
<https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>.

We recommend creating different branches for different (logical)
changes, and creating a pull request when you're done into the master branch.
See the GitHub documentation on
[creating branches](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/)
and
[using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

### How we handle proposals

We use GitHub to track all changes via its
[issue tracker](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/issues) and
[pull requests](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/pulls).
Specific changes are proposed using those mechanisms.
Issues are assigned to an individual, who works it and then marks it complete.
If there are questions or objections, the conversation area of that
issue or pull request is used to resolve it.

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

All contributions (including pull requests) must agree to
the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) version 1.1](doc/dco.txt).
This is exactly the same one created and used by the Linux kernel developers
and posted on <http://developercertificate.org/>.
This is a developer's certification that he or she has the right to
submit the patch for inclusion into the project.

Simply submitting a contribution implies this agreement, however,
please include a "Signed-off-by" tag in every patch
(this tag is a conventional way to confirm that you agree to the DCO).
You can do this with <tt>git commit --signoff</tt> (the <tt>-s</tt> flag
is a synonym for <tt>--signoff</tt>).

Another way to do this is to write the following at the end of the commit
message, on a line by itself separated by a blank line from the body of
the commit:

    Signed-off-by: YOUR NAME <YOUR.EMAIL@EXAMPLE.COM>

You can signoff by default in this project by creating a file
(say "git-template") that contains
some blank lines and the signed-off-by text above;
then configure git to use that as a commit template.  For example:

    git config commit.template ~/cii-best-practices-badge/git-template

It's not practical to fix old contributions in git, so if one is forgotten,
do not try to fix them.  We presume that if someone sometimes used a DCO,
a commit without a DCO is an accident and the DCO still applies.

### License (MIT)

All (new) contributed material must be released
under the [MIT license](./LICENSE).
All new contributed material
that is not executable, including all text when not executed,
is also released under the
[Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 International (CC BY 3.0) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) or later.

See the section on reuse for their license requirements
(they don't need to be MIT, but all required components must be
open source software).

### No trailing whitespace

Please do not use or include trailing whitespace
(spaces or tabs at the end of a line).
Since they are often not visible, they can cause silent problems
and misleading unexpected changes.
For example, some editors (e.g., Atom) quietly delete them by default.

### We are proactive

In general we try to be proactive to detect and eliminate
mistakes and vulnerabilities as soon as possible,
and to reduce their impact when they do happen.
We use a defensive design and coding style to reduce the likelihood of mistakes,
a variety of tools that try to detect mistakes early,
and an automatic test suite with significant coverage.
We also release the software as open source software so others can review it.

Since early detection and impact reduction can never be perfect, we also try to
detect and repair problems during deployment as quickly as possible.
This is *especially* true for security issues; see our
[security information](doc/security.md) for more.

## Vulnerability reporting (security issues)

If you find a significant vulnerability, or evidence of one,
please send an email to the security contacts that you have such
information, and we'll tell you the next steps.
For now, the security contacts are:
David A. Wheeler <dwheeler-NOSPAM@ida.org>,
Jason Dossett <jdossett-NOSPAM@ida.org>,
Dan Kohn <dankohn-NOSPAM@linux.com>,
and
Marcus Streets <mstreets-NOSPAM@linuxfoundation.org>
(remove the -NOSPAM markers).

We will gladly give credit to anyone who reports a vulnerability
so that we can fix it.
If you want to remain anonymous or pseudonymous instead,
please let us know that; we will gladly respect your wishes.

## Documentation changes

Most of the documentation is in "markdown" format.
All markdown files use the .md filename extension.

Where reasonable, limit yourself to Markdown
that will be accepted by different markdown processors
(e.g., what is specified by CommonMark or the original Markdown)
In practice we use
the version of Markdown implemented by GitHub when it renders .md files,
and you can use its extensions
(in particular, mark code snippets with the programming language used).
This version of markdown is sometimes called
[GitHub-flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).
In particular, blank lines separate paragraphs; newlines inside a paragraph
do *not* force a line break.
Beware - this is *not*
the same markdown algorithm used by GitHub when it renders
issue or pull comments; in those cases
[newlines in paragraph-like content are considered as real line breaks](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/);
unfortunately this other algorithm is *also* called
GitHub rendered markdown.
(Yes, it'd be better if there were standard different names
for different things.)

The style is basically that enforced by the "markdownlint" tool.
Don't use tab characters, avoid "bare" URLs (in a hypertext link, the
link text and URL should be on the same line), and try to limit
lines to 80 characters (but ignore the 80-character limit if that would
create bare URLs).
Using the "rake markdownlint" or "rake" command
(described below) implemented in the development
environment can detect some problems in the markdown.
That said, if you don't know how to install the development environment,
don't worry - we'd rather have your proposals, even if you don't know how to
check them that way.

Do not use trailing two spaces for line breaks, since these cannot be
seen and may be silently removed by some tools.
Instead, use <tt>&lt;br&nbsp;/&gt;</tt> (an HTML break).

## Code changes

To make changes to the "BadgeApp" web application that implements the criteria,
you may find the following helpful; [INSTALL.md](doc/INSTALL.md)
(installation information) and [implementation.md](doc/implementation.md)
(implementation information).

The code should strive to be DRY (don't repeat yourself),
clear, and obviously correct.
Some technical debt is inevitable, just don't bankrupt us with it.
Improved refactorizations are welcome.

Always ensure that all JavaScript and CSS styles are
in *separate* files, do not embed them in the HTML.
That includes any generated HTML.
That way we can use CSP entries
that harden the program against security attacks.

Below are guidelines for specific languages.

### Ruby

The web application is primarily written in Ruby on Rails.
Please generally follow the
[community Ruby style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)
and the complementary
[community Rails style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide).
Our continous integration setups runs Rubocop on each commit to ensure they're
being followed.
For example, in Ruby:

* [use two-space indents](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#spaces-indentation)
* [use Unix line-endings](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#crlf)
* [use single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#consistent-string-literals)
* [Use the Ruby 1.9 hash literal syntax when your hash keys are symbols.](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#hash-literals)
* [Prefer symbols instead of strings as hash keys](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#hash-literals)

In Ruby,
[prefer symbols over strings (especially as hash keys)](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#symbols-as-keys)
when they do not potentially come from the user.
Symbols are typically faster, with no loss of readability.
There is one big exception:
Data from JSON should normally be accessed with strings,
since that's how Ruby normally reads it.
Rails normally uses the type ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess,
where the difference between symbols and strings is ignored,
but JSON results use standard Ruby hashes where symbols and strings are
considered different; be careful to use the correct type in these cases.

We have designed the application to be thread-safe (Rails is itself
thread-safe, including its caching mechanism).
Please follow the guidelines in
[How Do I Know Whether My Rails App Is Thread-safe or Not?](https://bearmetal.eu/theden/how-do-i-know-whether-my-rails-app-is-thread-safe-or-not/);
see also
[How to test multithreaded code](http://www.mikeperham.com/2015/12/14/how-to-test-multithreaded-code/).
In short: Each concurrent request runs in its own thread.
Threads typically create objects within their own thread; they may also
read shared objects with impunity.
However, be extremely cautious about *changing* shared objects.
You should normally only change shared objects through mechanisms
designed for the purpose (e.g., the database or internal Rails cache).

In Ruby please prefer the String operations that do not have side-effects
(e.g., "+", "sub", or "gsub"), and consider freezing strings.

Do *not* modify a String literal in-place
(e.g., using "<<", "sub!", or "gsub!") until you have applied ".dup" to it.
There are current plans that
[Ruby 3's string literals will be immutable](https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz/status/634386185507311616).
See [issue 11473](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11473) for more.
Even if this doesn't happen, freezing string literals is both faster and
reduces the risk of accidentally modifying a shared string.
Use "dup" on a string literal to produce a mutable string;
since "dup" is already permitted in the language,
this provides a simple backwards-compatible way for us to indicate
that the String is mutable in this case.
For example, if you want to build a string using append, do this:

~~~~ruby
''.dup << 'Hello, ' << 'World'
~~~~

You may use the safe navigation operator '&amp;.' added in
[Ruby version 2.3.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/12/25/ruby-2-3-0-released/).
Our static analysis tools' parsers can now handle this syntax.
This means that this application *requires* Ruby version 2.3.0 or later to run.

When making new tests, if you need to modify the setup or teardown methods for a
test class, please use callbacks instead of overwrites; i.e.  use "setup do"
instead of "def setup."  This preserves any changes to those methods that
may have been made in test_helper.rb.

*Never* include user email addresses in the internal Rails cache.
Caches are stored for reuse later, and there's always the risk that
they will accidentally presented to another user not authorized to see it.
Otherwise, please *do* use caches to speed repeated responses where they
make sense.  Caches are one of the key mechanisms we use to provide
rapid responses to users.

Please use
[# frozen_string_literal: true](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8976)
at the beginning of each file.
This 'magic comment' (added in Ruby 2.3.0) automatically freezes
string literals, increasing speed, preventing accidental changes, and
will help us get ready for the planned Ruby transition
to immutable string literals.

Each source file should include a copyright and license statement
the beginning.  Here is our standard header:

~~~~ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# Copyright 2015-2017, the Linux Foundation, IDA, and the
# CII Best Practices badge contributors
# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
~~~~

### JavaScript

There is a small amount of application-specific client-side JavaScript;
by convention custom client-side JavaScript is in "app/assets/javascripts/".

This is written in JavaScript, not CoffeeScript;
it's only a small amount of JavaScript, so the advantages of
CoffeeScript aren't
obvious, and far more people know basic JavaScript than CoffeeScript.
Our JavaScript coding style is based on the
[Node.js style guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide).
In particular, we use
2-space indents, terminating semicolons, camelCase, required braces,
and '===' (never '==') for string comparison,
These coding style rules are checked by ESLint
(see .eslintrc for the rule list).

Always put JavaScript (and CSS styles) in *separate* files, do not
embed JavaScript in the HTML.  That way we can use CSP entries
that harden the program against security attacks.

If you edit the JavaScript, beware of ready events.
Rails' turbolinks gem claims that it
["works great with the jQuery framework"](https://github.com/rails/turbolinks),
but this is misleading.
[Turbolinks breaks $(document).ready](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html#page-change-events)
(an extremely common construct)
and by default requires you to use a nonstandard on..."page:change".
To solve this botch in turbolinks we use
[jquery-turbolinks](https://github.com/kossnocorp/jquery.turbolinks),
which makes "ready" work correctly.
Please do *not* use <tt>$(document).on('ready', function)</tt>,
because jquery-turbolinks doesn't fix those;
instead, use <tt>$(document).ready(function)</tt> or <tt>$(function)</tt>.

### Shell

There's a small amount of Bourne shell code
(the script that sets up a new development install).
If you modify it, make sure it passes shellcheck
(a static analysis tool for shell).

### Automated tests

When adding or changing functionality, please include new tests for them as
part of your contribution.

We require the Ruby code to have at least 90% statement coverage;
please ensure your contributions do not lower the coverage below that minimum.
The Ruby code uses minitest as the test framework, and we use
'vcr' to record live data for replaying later.
Additional tests are very welcome.

We encourage tests to be created first, run to ensure they fail, and
then add code to implement the test (aka test driven development).
However, each git commit should have both
the test and improvement in the *same* commit,
because 'git bisect' will then work well.

*WARNING*: It is possible that some tests may intermittently fail, even though
the software works fine.
If tests fail, restart to see if it's a problem with the software
or the tests.  On CircleCI you can choose to rebuild.
Where possible, try to find and fix the problem; we have worked to
eliminate this, and at this point believe we have fixed it.

If you use an old version of PhantomJS (e.g., if you use
Ubuntu 14.04 and install PhantomJS via apt-get), you'll see this
message during tests:

> You're running an old version of PhantomJS,
> update to >= 2.1.1 for a better experience.

You can eliminate the warnings about old versions of PhantomJS
by uninstalling the old version and installing a
[current version of PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html).

### Security, privacy, and performance

Pay attention to security, and work *with* (not against) our
security hardening mechanisms.  In particular, put JavaScript and CSS
in *separate* files - this makes it possible to have very strong
Content Security Policy (CSP) rules, which in turn greatly reduces
the impact of a software defect.  Be sure to use prepared statements
(including via Rails' ActiveRecord).
Protect private information, in particular passwords and email addresses.
Avoid mechanisms that could be used for tracking where possible
(we do need to verify people are logged in for some operations),
and ensure that third parties can't use interactions for tracking.
For more about security, see [security](doc/security.md).

We want the software to have decent performance for typical users.
[Our goal is interaction in 1 second or less after making a request](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail).
Don't send megabytes of data for a request
(see
[The Website Obesity Crisis](http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm)).
Use caching (at the server, CDN, and user side) to improve performance
in typical cases (while avoiding making the code too complicated).
Moving all the JavaScripts to a long-lived cached page, for example,
means that the user only needs to load that page once.
See the "other tools" list below for some tools to help measure performance.
There's always a trade-off between various attributes, in particular,
don't make performance so fast that the software is hard to maintain.
Instead, work to get "reasonable" performance in typical cases.

## How to check proposed changes before submitting them

Before submitting changes, you *must*
run 'rake' (no options) to look for problems,
and fix the problems found.
In some cases it's okay to fix them by disabling the warning in that particular
place, but be careful; it's often better to make a real change,
even if it doesn't matter in that particular case.

### Standard checks

The specific list of tools run by default using 'rake' is listed in
[default.rake](lib/tasks/default.rake).
Currently these include at least the following rake tasks that
check the software:

*   *bundle* - use bundle to check dependencies
    ("bundle check || bundle install")
*   *bundle_doctor* - sanity check on Ruby gem configuration/installation
*   *bundle_audit* - check for transitive gem dependencies with
    known vulnerabilities
*   *rubocop* - runs Rubocop, which checks Ruby code style against the
    [community Ruby style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)
*   *markdownlint* - runs markdownlint, also known as mdl
    (this checks for errors in the markdown text)
*   *rails_best_practices* - check Ruby against rails best practices
    using the gem
    [rails_best_practices](http://rails-bestpractices.com/)
*   *brakeman* - runs Brakeman, which is a static source code analyzer
    to look for Ruby on Rails security vulnerabilities
*   *license_okay* - runs license_finder to check the
    OSS licenses of gem dependencies (transitively).
    A separate dependency on file 'license_finder_report.html' generates
    a detailed license report in HTML format.
*   *whitespace_check* - runs "git diff --check" to detect
    trailing whitespace in latest diff
    *yaml_syntax_check* - checks syntax of YAML (.yml) files.
    Note that the automated test suite includes a number of specific
    checks on the criteria/criteria.yml file.
*   *fasterer* - report on Ruby constructs with poor performance
    (temporarily disabled until it supports Ruby 2.4)
*   *eslint* - Perform code style check on JavaScript using eslint
*   *test* - run the automated test suite

Running "rake test" (the automated test suite) will show
"Run options: --seed ...", "# Running:", and a series of dots (passing tests).

### Expected noise from 'rake'

Ruby 2.4.0 has deprecated the Fixnum and Bignum classes, but they are used
by some gems we depend on.
Because we now use Ruby 2.4.0, there may be several warnings of this form:

~~~~
FILENAME.rb:LINE: warning: constant ::Fixnum is deprecated
FILENAME.rb:LINE: warning: constant ::Bignum is deprecated
~~~~

In some cases you'll see a test retry message like this
(but it will eventually pass):

~~~~
..[MinitestRetry] retry 'test_0002_Can Login and edit using custom account'
count: 1,  msg: Unexpected exception
~~~~

The retry messages, when they happen, come from
the few tests we use that use a full simulated web browser (via Capybara).
Sometimes these full tests cause spurious failures, so we intentionally
retry failing tests to eliminate false failure reports (to make sure the
problem is in the software under test, and not in our test framework).

### Other tools

Here are some other tools we use for checking quality or security,
though they are not currently integrated
into the default "rake" checking task:

* OWASP ZAP web application security scanner.
  You are encouraged to use this and other web application scanners to find and
  fix problems.
* JSCS (JavaScript style checker) using the Node.js format.
* JSHint (JavaScript error detector)
* W3C link checker <https://validator.w3.org/checklink>
* W3C markup validation service <https://validator.w3.org/>
* AChecker, <https://achecker.ca/checker/index.php>, a web accessibility
  checker.  This tool looks for web accessibility problems.
  We typically check the following paths
  (these are key forms in the system): "/", "/signup", "/login",
  "/projects", and "/projects/1".
  Our goal is to have no known problems and no likely problems per this tool
  (this was true on 2017-06-03).
  The "potential problems" list is very noisy, so we don't worry
  about that list as much.

Here are some online tools we sometimes use to check for performance issues
(including time to complete rendering, download size in bytes, etc.):

* [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)
* [Varvy PageSpeed](https://varvy.com/pagespeed/)
* [Yellow lab tools](http://yellowlab.tools/) - Examines performance.
  It can notice issues like excessive accesses of the DOM from JavaScript.
  It's OSS; see
  ([YellowLabTools on GitHub](https://github.com/gmetais/YellowLabTools))
* [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com/)

This
[article on Rails front end performance](https://www.viget.com/articles/rails-front-end-performance)
may be of use to you if you're interested in performance.

We sometimes run this to check if assets compile properly (see
[heroku_rails_deflate](https://github.com/mattolson/heroku_rails_deflate)):

~~~~
RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile
~~~~

### Testing during continuous integration

Note that we also use
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge)
for continuous integration tools to check changes
after they are checked into GitHub; if they find problems, please fix them.
These run essentially the same set of checks as the default rake task.

## Git commit messages

When writing git commit messages, try to follow the guidelines in
[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):

1.  Separate subject from body with a blank line
2.  Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
    (We're flexible on this, but *do* limit it to 72 characters or less.)
3.  Capitalize the subject line
4.  Do not end the subject line with a period
5.  Use the imperative mood in the subject line (*command* form)
6.  Wrap the body at 72 characters ("<tt>fmt -w 72</tt>")
7.  Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
    (git tracks how it was changed in detail, don't repeat that)

## Reuse (supply chain)

### Requirements for reused components

We like reusing components, but please evaluate all new components
before adding them.
We want to reduce our risks of depending on software that is poorly
maintained or has vulnerabilities (intentional or unintentional).

#### Requirements for reused Ruby gems

In most cases we add reusable components by adding Ruby gems.
Here are guidelines for adding Ruby gems:

* Before adding a Ruby gem, check its popularity on
  <https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/>, and prefer "more popular" gems.
  A popular gem may have unintentional or intentional vulnerabilities,
  but they are less likely, and are more likely to be noticed.
* For Ruby gems, look at its data at <https://rubygems.org/> to learn
  more about it. E.G., is it still actively maintained?
  (e.g., it uses semantic versioning and have a ChangeLog).
* For some tips on how to evaluate gems, see
  <a href="https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/open-source-software-whats-in-a-poke">"Back-end Open-Source Software: What is in a poke?"
  by Sergey Dolganov (January 26, 2017)</a>.
* All required reused components MUST be open source software (OSS).
  It is *not* acceptable to insert a dependency
  that *requires* proprietary software; making it portable so it *can* use
  some proprietary software is gratefully welcome.
  We also have to combine them legally in the way they are used.

If you add a Ruby gem, put its *fixed* version number in the Gemfile file,
and please add a brief comment to explain what it is and/or why it's there.

#### Requirements for reused components in general

For any reused software, here are a few general rules:

* Prefer software that
  appears to be currently maintained (e.g., has recent updates),
  has more than one developer, and appears to be applying good practices
* In general, prefer a Rails-specific gem over a generic Ruby gem, and
  for JavaScript Node.js packages prefer a Ruby gem that repackages it.
  The repackage will often help make it work more cleanly
  with the Rails application, and it also suggests that the package is
  a more common one (and thus more likely to be maintained).
* Check if the gem is thread-safe, in particular, avoid gems that
  don't control modifying objects shared between threads.
  This is less of an issue today, because in many cases the objects
  being modified are not being shared, and threaded implementations
  have become common (Heroku encourages them).

Someday we hope to add "have one of our badges" as a preference.

#### License requirements for reused components

All *required* reused software *must* be open source software (OSS).
It's okay to *optionally* use proprietary software and add
portability fixes.
We use 'license_finder' to help ensure that we're using OSS legally.
We generally use SPDX license expressions to describe licenses.

In general we want to use GPL-compatible OSS licenses.
Acceptable licenses include MIT,
BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" or "FreeBSD" License (BSD-2-Clause),
BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License (BSD-3-Clause), the
[original Ruby license](https://spdx.org/licenses/Ruby.html) (Ruby) or the
[current Ruby license](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/license.txt)
(the latter includes BSD-2-Clause as an option),
GNU Library or "Lesser" General Public License (any version),
GNU General Public License version 2.0 or later (GPL-2.0+), and the
GNU General Public License version 3.0 ("or later" or not)
(either GPL-3.0 or GPL-3.0+).

We can use Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)
and GPL-2.0 exactly (GNU GPL version 2.0 only),
but Apache-2.0 and GPL-2.0 (only) have potential compatibility issues.
First check if that Apache-2.0 and GPL-2.0 only components are
in separate executables (if so, no problem).
Most software licensed using the GPL version 2.0 is actually
GPL-2.0+ (GPL version 2 or later), and GPL version 3 is known to be
compatible with the Apache 2.0 license, so this is not a common problem.
For more on license decisions see doc/dependency_decisions.yml;
you can also run 'rake' and see the generated report
license_finder_report.html.
Once you've checked, you can approve a library and its license with the
this command (this quickly modifies doc/dependency_decisions.yml;
you can edit the file as well):

~~~~
license_finder approval add --who=WHO --why=WHY GEM-NAME
~~~~

### Updating reused components

For stability we set fixed version numbers for Ruby and the Ruby gems.

#### Updating Ruby gems

We use the bundler Ruby gem package management system (<http://bundler.io>);
file 'Gemfile' lists direct gem dependencies; 'Gemfile.lock' lists them
transitively.
In short, we have strong package management
over the exact versions used for each gem, and we
can easily update our dependencies.
That's important, because we transitively depend on over 150 gems.

The default 'rake' task includes the rake 'bundle_audit' task.
This reports if a Ruby gem we use has a publicly known
vulnerability listed in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
Thus, simply running 'rake' will immediately warn you if there is a
publicly known vulnerability in the version of a gem we use.
Obviously, if there is a known vulnerability you *definitely* need
to update that gem.

To find all outdated gems, use the 'bundle outdated' command.
Our continuous integration suite (linked to from the README) also uses
[Gemnasium](https://gemnasium.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge)
to identify all outdated dependencies, so you can also view its report
to see what is outdated.
Many of the gems named "action..." are part of rails, and thus, you should
update rails to update them.

I recommend updating in stages (instead of all at once) since this
makes it easier to debug problems (if any).  Here is a suggested order,
though these are only suggestions.

First, update gems that are only indirectly depended on.
(These are gems listed in Gemfile.lock, but *not* listed in Gemfile.)
If you happen to know that a particular gem is large,
or has a higher risk of problems, or just want to be more methodical,
you can update a specific gem using "bundle update GEM".
(Ignore the gems named as "action...".)
You can just run "bundle update" to update them all at once.
Then run "rake" to make sure it works;
and if it does, use "git commit -a" to commit that change.

Next, edit the file Gemfile to update versions of gems depended on directly.
It's best to do this one line at a time if you can, though in some
cases it may be necessary to update several at the same time.
If you see gems with names beginning with "active",
those are gems in rails; update the Gemfile to change the version of
the 'rails' gem instead.  Once edited, run:

~~~~
bundle update && rake
~~~~

If that works commit the change with a git comment with summary form
'Update gem GEM_NAME'.

Updates sometimes fail.  In particular, sometimes one gem has been
update but a related gem is temporarily incompatible.

It's important to occasionally try to update.
However, it's usually not possible to keep
everything perfectly up-to-date, because
different gems' specifications forbid it.
It's normal to have some gems that are not the latest.
The key is to replace gem versions that have security vulnerabilities,
and to not get *too* far behind (if it's too far back it's
harder to update).

Historically the gems that cause trouble updating in this app are
github_api, octokit, and the various "pronto" gems.

If an update fails, you can use this to undo it:

~~~~
git checkout -- Gemfile Gemfile.lock
bundle update
~~~~

You can learn more about "bundle update" by running
"bundle help update".

Again, you *must* run 'rake' after updating; this will run the
regression tests, check the licenses (transitively, which is important because
sometimes library updates add new dependencies), and so on.
One of the main reasons we maintain a strong testsuite, and have
a number of other automated checks, is so that we can quickly and
confidently update gems.

Updates should be handled as a separate commit from functional improvements.
One exception: it's okay if the commit includes
both a component update and the minimum set of code changes to
make the update work.

#### Updating Ruby (and handling Ruby updates)

Ruby itself can be updated.
You can change the Ruby version yourself, and
when you use git pull the current version of Ruby in use could change.
There are extra steps needed when Ruby is updated; here they are.

In particular, if you try to run commands and you see errors like this,
you need to update your local installation of Ruby:

~~~~
rbenv: version \`2.3.9' is not installed (set by .../.ruby-version)
~~~~

The current version of Ruby used in the project is stored in
the file `.ruby-version` in the project's top directory
(for example, file Gemfile declares that the ruby version
used is whatever is in ".ruby-version").
The `.ruby-version` file is controlled by git.

If you want to change the current version of Ruby used in the project,
use `cd` to go this project's top directory,
and use 'git pull' to ensure this branch is up-to-date.
You should normally use `git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME` for the new branch.
Then run the following command:

~~~~sh
./update-ruby NEW_VERSION_NUMBER
~~~~

Note at the end of this script a `git commit -as` will be initiated,
but you will need to be sure to run `git push` after doing this.

If you've done a `git pull` and the Ruby version has changed in file
`.ruby-version` (e.g., you're seeing the rbenv: version... not installed
error message), you need to run these similar steps:

~~~~sh
./update-ruby
~~~~

For more details about updating Ruby versions with rbenv, see
<https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build> and
<http://dan.carley.co/blog/2012/02/07/rbenv-and-bundler/>.
Note that 'rbenv install 2.3.0' is equivalent to the longer
<tt>ruby-build 2.3.0 $HOME/.rbenv/versions/2.3.0</tt>.

If you update Ruby but don't update the parser gem
(e.g., a new version may not be available yet), you'll get a number
of warnings from the static analysis tools that we run via rake.
Where possible, consider updating the parser gem as well.
These warnings will look like these:

~~~~
warning: parser/current is loading parser/ruby22, which recognizes
warning: 2.2.x-compliant syntax, but you are running 2.3.0.
warning: please see https://github.com/whitequark/parser#compatibility-with-ruby-mri.
~~~~

Once the component update has been verified,
it can be checked in as a new commit.

## Keeping up with external changes

The installer adds a git remote named 'upstream'.
Running 'git pull upstream master' will pull the current version from
upstream, enabling you to sync with upstream.

You can reset this, if something has happened to it, using:

~~~~sh
git remote add upstream \
    https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge.git
~~~~

If the version of Ruby has changed (in the Gemfile),
use the 'Ruby itself can be updated' instructions.
If gems have been added or their versions changed,
run "bundle install" to install the new ones.
