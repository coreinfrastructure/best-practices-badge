# Historically we tested the contents of robots.txt for both
# true production and the other sites as separate system tests.
# However, it's tricky to do this as a system test;
# you have to modify the environment variable & clear the cache.
# This makes the tests not able to run in parallel within a process.
# It would be better to implement one as a unit test (if desired)
# so we don't need to modify the environment variables (which are shared).
#
# Robots.txt is cached, since it usually is unchanged in execution.
# We must clear the cache so we can test under different circumstances.
