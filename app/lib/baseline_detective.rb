# Baseline Detective - Reserved for baseline-specific automated checks that
# don't have equivalents in the metal series. Currently all baseline
# automation is handled by extending existing detectives
# (FlossLicenseDetective, RepoFilesExamineDetective,
# GithubBasicDetective, ProjectSitesHttpsDetective) to output both metal
# and baseline fields from a single analysis.
#
# This detective is kept as a placeholder for future baseline-unique checks.
