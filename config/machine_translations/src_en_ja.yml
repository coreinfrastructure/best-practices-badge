        details: This may take the form of a package manager or language dependency file that enumerates all direct dependencies such as package.json, Gemfile, or go.mod.
      osps_qa_04_01:
        description: While active, the project documentation MUST contain a list of any codebases that are considered subprojects.
        details: Document any additional subproject code repositories produced by the project and compiled into a release. This documentation should include the status and intent of the respective codebase.
      osps_qa_05_01:
        description: While active, the version control system MUST NOT contain generated executable artifacts.
        details: Remove generated executable artifacts in the project's version control system.

      osps_br_02_01:
        description: When an official release is created, that release MUST be assigned a unique version identifier.
        details: Assign a unique version identifier to each release produced by the project, following a consistent naming convention or numbering scheme. Examples include SemVer, CalVer, or git commit id.
      osps_br_04_01:
        description: When an official release is created, that release MUST contain a descriptive log of functional and security modifications.
        details: Ensure that all releases include a descriptive change log. It is recommended to ensure that the change log is human-readable and includes details beyond commit messages, such as descriptions of the security impact or relevance to different use cases. To ensure machine readability, place the content under a markdown header such as "## Changelog".
      osps_br_05_01:
        description: When a build and release pipeline ingests dependencies, it MUST use standardized tooling where available.
        details: Use a common tooling for your ecosystem, such as package managers or dependency management tools to ingest dependencies at build time. This may include using a dependency file, lock file, or manifest to specify the required dependencies, which are then pulled in by the build system.

        description: Prior to a commit being accepted, the project's CI/CD pipelines MUST run at least one automated test suite to ensure the changes meet expectations.
        details: Automated tests should be run prior to every merge into the primary branch. The test suite should be run in a CI/CD pipeline and the results should be visible to all contributors. The test suite should be run in a consistent environment and should be run in a way that allows contributors to run the tests locally.

      osps_br_02_02:
        description: When an official release is created, all assets within that release MUST be clearly associated with the release identifier or another unique identifier for the asset.

      osps_do_03_01:
        description: When the project has made a release, the project documentation MUST contain instructions to verify the integrity and authenticity of the release assets.
        details: Instructions in the project should contain information about the technology used, the commands to run, and the expected output. When possible, avoid storing this documentation in the same location as the build and release pipeline to avoid a single breach compromising both the software and the documentation for verifying the integrity of the software.
      osps_do_03_02:
        description: When the project has made a release, the project documentation MUST contain instructions to verify the expected identity of the person or process authoring the software release.
        details: The expected identity may be in the form of key IDs used to sign, issuer and identity from a sigstore certificate, or other similar forms.

        details: Publish an enforceable policy in the project documentation that requires code collaborators to be reviewed and approved before being granted escalated permissions to sensitive resources, such as merge approval or access to secrets. It is recommended that vetting includes establishing a justifiable lineage of identity such as confirming the contributor's association with a known trusted organization.
      osps_qa_02_02:
        description: When the project has made a release, all compiled released software assets MUST be delivered with a software bill of materials.
        details: It is recommended to auto-generate SBOMs at build time using a tool that has been vetted for accuracy. This enables users to ingest this data in a standardized approach alongside other projects in their environment.
      osps_qa_04_02:
        description: When the project has made a release comprising multiple source code repositories, all subprojects MUST enforce security requirements that are as strict or stricter than the primary codebase.
        details: Any additional subproject code repositories produced by the project and compiled into a release must enforce security requirements as applicable to the status and intent of the respective codebase. In addition to following the corresponding OSPS Baseline requirements, this may include requiring a security review, ensuring that it is free of vulnerabilities, and ensuring that it is free of known security issues.

        details: Configure the project's version control system to require at least one non-author human approval of changes before merging into the release or primary branch. This can be achieved by requiring a pull request to be reviewed and approved by at least one other collaborator before it can be merged.

        description: When the project has made a release, the project MUST perform a threat modeling and attack surface analysis to understand and protect against attacks on critical code paths, functions, and interactions within the system.
        details: Threat modeling is an activity where the project looks at the codebase, associated processes and infrastructure, interfaces, key components and "thinks like a hacker" and brainstorms how the system be be broken or compromised. Each identified threat is listed out so the project can then think about how to proactively avoid or close off any gaps/vulnerabilities that could arise. Ensure this is updated for new features or breaking changes.
      osps_vm_04_02:
        description: While active, any vulnerabilities in the software components not affecting the project MUST be accounted for in a VEX document, augmenting the vulnerability report with non-exploitability details.
        details: Establish a VEX feed communicating the exploitability status of known vulnerabilities, including assessment details or any mitigations in place preventing vulnerable code from being executed.
      osps_vm_05_01:
        description: While active, the project documentation MUST include a policy that defines a threshold for remediation of SCA findings related to vulnerabilities and licenses.
        details: Document a policy in the project that defines a threshold for remediation of SCA findings related to vulnerabilities and licenses. Include the process for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating these findings.
      osps_vm_05_02:
        description: While active, the project documentation MUST include a policy to address SCA violations prior to any release.
        details: Document a policy in the project to address applicable Software Composition Analysis results before any release, and add status checks that verify compliance with that policy prior to release.
      osps_vm_05_03:
        description: While active, all changes to the project's codebase MUST be automatically evaluated against a documented policy for malicious dependencies and known vulnerabilities in dependencies, then blocked in the event of violations, except when declared and suppressed as non-exploitable.
        details: Create a status check in the project's version control system that runs a Software Composition Analysis tool on all changes to the codebase. Require that the status check passes before changes can be merged.
      osps_vm_06_01:
        description: While active, the project documentation MUST include a policy that defines a threshold for remediation of SAST findings.
        details: Document a policy in the project that defines a threshold for remediation of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) findings. Include the process for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating these findings.
      osps_vm_06_02:
        description: While active, all changes to the project's codebase MUST be automatically evaluated against a documented policy for security weaknesses and blocked in the event of violations except when declared and suppressed as non-exploitable.
        details: Create a status check in the project's version control system that runs a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool on all changes to the codebase. Require that the status check passes before changes can be merged.
