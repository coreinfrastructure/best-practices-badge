<p>The members of the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge
Technical Steering Committee (TSC) are:</p>

<ul>
<li>David A. Wheeler (@david-a-wheeler) [The Linux Foundation]</li>
<li>Christopher &quot;CRob&quot; Robinson (@SecurityCRob) [The Linux Foundation]</li>
<li>Tony Hansen (@TonyLHansen) [AT&amp;T]</li>
</ul>

<p>Members represent themselves, not their employers.
We note employers because we want to ensure that no single organization
controls this project (the Linux Foundation represents other organizations
so we aren&#39;t worrying about that).</p>

<p>The initial &quot;@&quot; indicates the GitHub id.</p>

<p>TSC members do not necessarily have admin access to the production
web application, but they may.</p>
