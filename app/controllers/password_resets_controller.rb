  # NOTE: password resets *always* reply with the same message, in all cases.
  # At one time we replied with error reports if there was no account or if
  # there was a GitHub account (not a local account) with the email address.
  # However, that allowed attackers to determine if a given email address
  # was present or not in an account. That's not a large leak of
  # information; the attacker has to already guess the specific email address,
  # and they merely get "is present/absent" instead of the specific account.
  # Many systems *do* provide such error messages, so many users would
  # be unsurprised by this information leak.
  # Still, we want to be excellent at providing user privacy, so we're
  # going to go beyond what some might see as the minimum, and instead
  # do what we can to maximize our users' privacy.
