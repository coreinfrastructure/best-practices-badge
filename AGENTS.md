This file provides guidance to an AI assistant when working with the code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **OpenSSF Best Practices Badge** project (formerly CII Best Practices Badge), a Rails web application that helps FLOSS projects self-certify that they meet security and quality best practices. The application provides a badging system with "metal" levels (passing, silver, and gold) and "baseline" levels (1, 2, and 3).

This software is open source software. The production site running this code is extremely busy and always under attack. High performance and strong security are required. Minimize creating new objects after initialization, as unchecked memory growth leads to crashes.

Long-term maintainability is critical. Minimize the amount of code by preferring to reuse existing infrastructure and refactoring common code into methods.

When you have difficulty fixing a bug or making a change, determine the root cause and find ways to systemically prevent similar problems in the future. For example:

* Add a test to detect similar problems
* Improve bug feedback mechanisms (better error messages, fail-fast checks)
* Add documentation near the construct in use

However, documentation is often unnoticed and too much can obscure what's important. Prefer automated prevention (tests, type checks, linters) over documentation when possible.

## Common Development Commands

### Testing

- `rake test:optimized` - Run all tests (unit and system). Takes a long time.
- `rails test test/integration/project_list_test.rb` - Run specified test file
- `rails test test/features/can_access_home_test.rb:4` - Run a test at line 4 of the specified test file.
- `rake precompile` - Rebuild `public/assets`. Run this after changing
  anything under `app/assets`, *before* running `rails test` directly.

After an asset changes, a middleware refuses requests until the compiled
assets are rebuilt, so tests fail with:

```text
RuntimeError: Stale precompiled assets detected! Run: rake assets:precompile
```

That error is easy to misread. It surfaces on the first request a test
makes, so the backtrace points at whatever issued that request, usually
`log_in_as` in `test/test_helper.rb`, and it looks like an unrelated
authentication failure in tests you did not touch. Note that editing a file
is enough to trigger it: the check compares timestamps, not contents, so
even a comment-only change to a `.js` file will do it.

`rake test:optimized` precompiles first and never hits this. Only a direct
`rails test` does.

To see test names, set environment variable SLOW=true e.g.,
`SLOW=true rake test:optimized`.

We require 100% statement coverage. We avoid using :nocov: because Ruby
only does dynamic type-checking. Lines of code that are *never*
tested have an increased risk of causing production failures.

### Code Quality & Linting

- `rake default` - Run local CI/CD pipeline (linting, tests, etc.).

   Don't just use `rake` without arguments, Claude's user permission
   system can't permit that without permitting all rake commands.
   Some additional checks (e.g., Brakeman) run on GitHub's CI/CD pipeline.

- `rake rubocop` - Ruby style checker
- `rake rails_best_practices` - Rails-specific best practices source checker
- `rake markdownlint` - Markdown linting
- `rake eslint` - JavaScript linting
- `rake whitespace_check` - Check for trailing whitespace
- `rake yaml_syntax_check` - YAML syntax validation
- `rake bundle_audit` - Security audit of gems

For specific files:

- `mdl FILENAME.md` - Markdownlint only the file `FILENAME.md`
- `rubocop FILENAME.rb` - Run rubocop on just `FILENAME.rb`

**Markdown Helper Script**:

After creating or editing markdown files, youcan use the markdown fixer script to automatically fix common markdownlint errors:

```bash
# Fix markdown file in-place (most common usage):
script/fix_markdown.rb docs/MYFILE.md

# See what would be fixed without changing the file:
script/fix_markdown.rb --dry-run docs/MYFILE.md

# After fixing, verify with markdownlint:
mdl docs/MYFILE.md
```

Don't run `rails_best_practices` to analyze individual files.
The `rails_best_practices` program needs the full context of all files
to do its best.

**IMPORTANT**: You may ONLY use `rubocop -a` (safe autocorrect)
for RuboCop corrections.

**NEVER use `rubocop -A` (unsafe autocorrect)** -
it frequently introduces subtle bugs by making assumptions
about code context that are incorrect.

### Workflow

After making significant changes to source code, ALWAYS run linters, e.g.,
rubocop for Ruby files and mdl for markdown files.

Also run `rake whitespace_check` to catch trailing whitespace, and fix them.

### Development Environment Shortcut

As a convenience, in the development environment you don't need to use
`bundle exec` prefixes for ruby commands (though you may use them).
They *are* necessary in cases, such as rake tasks, that might be
used in the CI or production environments.

### Security Analysis

GitHub runs Brakeman for static security analysis via
`.github/workflows/brakeman.yml` (gating the main branch), and CodeQL where
configured; this is not done on the local system. Brakeman's accepted
findings are recorded in `config/brakeman.ignore`.

GitHub also runs the OSS license check via
`.github/workflows/license_finder.yml`, gating the main branch the same
way. `license_finder` is not in the `Gemfile`: it's a CI-only analyzer, not
an app dependency (installed standalone with `gem install`, like
Brakeman), so its outdated `rubyzip` dependency (pinned to `< 3`, and thus
vulnerable to CVE-2026-85396) never enters the app's dependency graph.
Approved licenses are recorded in `docs/dependency_decisions.yml`.

### Development Server

- `rails s` - Start development server (http://localhost:3000)
- `rails console` - Start Rails console for debugging

## Architecture & Key Concepts

### Core Models

- **Project** - Central model representing a FLOSS project seeking certification
  - Has three badge levels: passing, silver, gold (plus `in_progress`)
  - Uses PostgreSQL full-text search via `pg_search` gem
  - Stores criteria answers and justifications
  - Heavy security validation and input sanitization

- **User** - Project owners and contributors
  - Email addresses are encrypted in database using `attr_encrypted`
  - Uses OAuth (GitHub) and local authentication
  - Session management with automatic timeouts

- **Criteria** - The best practices criteria that projects must meet
  - Dynamic criteria system supporting multiple languages
  - Complex validation rules and automated checking

### Security Architecture

Security is *extremely* important to this project. Some features:

- **Encrypted Data**: User emails encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **Blind Indexing**: Email searches use blind indices for privacy
- **CSRF Protection**: All forms protected with Rails CSRF tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: Uses `rack-attack` for DoS protection
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers via `secure_headers` gem
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Force SSL in production
- **IP Validation**: Optional Fastly IP allowlisting (cloud piercing protection)

The file `docs/assurance-case.md` explains why we *believe* this is secure.

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Multi-provider**: GitHub OAuth + local accounts
- **Session Security**: Automatic timeouts, secure cookies
- **Additional Rights**: Project collaborator system via `additional_rights` table
- **Admin System**: Special admin user capabilities

### Internationalization

- **Multi-language Support**: Currently supports 6+ languages
- **URL Structure**: Routes include locale (e.g., `/en/projects`, `/fr/projets`)
- **Locale Handling**: Automatic locale detection and redirection
- **Translation Management**: Uses `translation.io` service

### Performance & Caching

- **CDN Integration**: Fastly CDN for badge images and static assets
- **Database Optimization**: Careful indexing, connection pooling
- **Pagination**: Uses `pagy` gem
- **Asset Pipeline**: Rails asset pipeline with Sass compilation

### Background Jobs

- **solid_queue**: ActiveJob backend for async processing
- **Email System**: Reminder emails, user notifications
- **Data Tasks**: Daily/monthly maintenance tasks

## Key Configuration Files

- `config/application.rb` - Core Rails app configuration
- `config/routes.rb` - Complex routing with locale support
- `lib/tasks/default.rake` - Custom rake tasks including full CI pipeline

The directory `config`, especially `config/initializers`,
has many configuration files.

## Development Practices

### Code Style

- **Frozen String Literals**: All files must include `# frozen_string_literal: true`
- **Security Headers**: Each file has copyright and SPDX-License-Identifier
- **Refinements**: Uses custom `StringRefinements` and `SymbolRefinements`
- **Method Documentation**: Use YARD format for documenting public methods in classes and modules:
  - `@param name [Type] description` - documents parameters
  - `@return [Type] description` - documents return values
  - `@raise [ExceptionClass] description` - documents exceptions
  - Focus on non-obvious methods; private helpers don't always need documentation

- **Inline Comments**: Use multi-line comment blocks when they are helpful,
  especially to explain non-obvious WHY (hidden constraints, subtle invariants,
  security rationale, workarounds for specific bugs). Do not limit comments to
  one line when more context aids understanding.

### Testing Strategy

- **Minitest**: Uses Rails' default Minitest framework
- **System Tests**: Capybara-based browser automation tests
- **Parallel Safe**: Tests designed for process parallelism (not thread safe)
- **Coverage**: Maintains high test coverage via codecov integration

### Security Requirements

Security is *VERY* important in this application.

- **DCO Required**: All commits must be signed off per Developer Certificate of Origin
- **No Sensitive Data**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or encryption keys
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs heavily validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Always uses Rails parameterized queries (including its ORM) with untrusted input
- **XSS Prevention**: Uses templates to prevent XSS
- User inputs should be checked for expected format and length.
- When applicable, generate unit tests for security-critical functions (including negative tests to ensure the code fails safely).
- Do not add dependencies that may be malicious or hallucinated.
- Never log, expose, or commit passwords, API keys, encryption keys, or other secrets.

### Version Control

- **Git Workflow**: Feature branches with pull request review
- **Commit Signing**: DCO sign-off required (`git commit --signoff`)
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch requires review and CI passage
- **AI Assistance**: When an AI coding assistant helped produce a commit,
  record it with an `Assisted-by:` trailer, using the Linux kernel's
  `AGENT_NAME:MODEL_VERSION` format. `MODEL_VERSION` is the identifier the
  vendor publishes, copied verbatim: use `claude-opus-5`, not
  `Claude Opus 5` or `claude-5-opus`. Give each agent its own line. Do not use
  `Co-authored-by:` for an AI; that implies authorship, and copyright
  requires human creative activity. Only a human adds `Signed-off-by:`,
  which certifies the DCO and is a claim an AI cannot make.

  ```text
  Signed-off-by: Jane Developer <jane@example.com>
  Assisted-by: Claude:claude-opus-5
  ```

## Environment Variables

Key environment variables for development:

- `RAILS_ENV` - Rails environment (development/test/production)
- `EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - 64 hex digits for email encryption
- `EMAIL_BLIND_INDEX_KEY` - 64 hex digits for email search indices
- `BADGEAPP_REAL_PRODUCTION` - Set to "true" only on true production site
- `PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` - Hostname for the application
- `DB_POOL` - Database connection pool size

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Database Issues

- Email encryption keys must be exactly 64 hex digits (256 bits)
- Use `rails db:reset` carefully - will destroy all local data
- PostgreSQL full-text search requires specific indices

### Testing Issues

- System tests require JavaScript driver setup
- Tests are process-parallel safe but NOT thread-safe
- Use `RAILS_ENV=test` for test database operations

### Security Considerations

- Badge image URLs must be canonical for CDN caching
- All user input requires validation and sanitization
- Session timeouts are enforced - don't extend arbitrarily
- Rate limiting is aggressive - be aware when testing

## Important File Locations

- `app/models/project.rb` - Core project model with badge logic
- `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` - Base controller with security
- `config/routes.rb` - Complex internationalized routing
- `docs/` - Extensive documentation including security assurance case
- `lib/tasks/default.rake` - CI pipeline and custom tasks
- `test/` - Comprehensive test suite

## Temporary File Convention

- ALL temporary files' filenames must be prefixed with a comma

  (e.g., `,temp-notes.md`, `,migration-plan.txt`)

- This applies to documentation, scratch files, migration plans, etc.
- The linting tools are configured to ignore comma-prefixed files

## Rails Conventions

This application mostly follows Rails 5+ baseline conventions with
selective upgrades:

* It most follows Rails 5 conventions in terms of
  directory structure, extensive use of `Rails.application.config.*`,
  an asset pipeline with a Rails 5+ Sprockets setup, and initializer structure.

* It has some older remnants:
  - Some older asset organization (app/assets/javascripts vs modern
    app/javascript), still served by `sprockets-rails`

* Some Rails 6+ features in use:
  - Modern gems: E.g., Rails, `solid_queue`, `secure_headers`
  - Security configurations: Advanced CSRF, CSP headers
  - Database setup: Modern PostgreSQL configuration
  - `config/application.rb` sets `config.load_defaults 8.1`, adopted
    incrementally rather than all at once, with a comment there listing
    the key effect of each version from 5.0 onward

We want to slowly move to more recent Rails conventions. Do that the way
`load_defaults` was done: one increment at a time, understanding what
each step changes. Rapid moves such as running `rails app:update`
directly are likely to cause a cascade of changes, leading to many
hard-to-fix failures with little obvious external benefit.

## Simple DRY code

It's critically important to make the code small and
DRY (don't repeat yourself). If the same function or method is written
more than once, it's wrong. If many lines are duplicated between
functions/methods, it's usually wrong.

Prefer having many small pure methods called by others.

## Miscellaneous

IMPORTANT: Never have trailing whitespace in text-like files including
source code and markdown files.
