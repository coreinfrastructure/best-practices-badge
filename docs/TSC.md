# Technical Steering Committee (TSC) Members

<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: (MIT OR CC-BY-3.0+) -->

The members of the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge
Technical Steering Committee (TSC) are:

* Christopher "CRob" Robinson (@SecurityCRob) [Intel]
* David A. Wheeler (@david-a-wheeler) [The Linux Foundation]

Members represent themselves, not their employers.
We note employers because we want to ensure that no single organization
controls this project.

The plan is to extend this list of TSC members; the goal is to
get started with the TSC construct that is new to the best practices badge.
