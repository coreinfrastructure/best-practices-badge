# Rubocop configuration
#
# Note: Rubocop continuously adds new cops. Sometimes applying them
# is safely automated, but sometimes they aren't (or the safe automation
# is only available in a later version of Rubocop).
# Here are some options:
# 1. Always implement new cops, even if they require lots of manual work.
#    Trying to do this is extremely time-consuming and risky, because
#    we already have a code base, and it's often not worth it.
# 2. Freeze on one (old) version. But then we never get the improvements
#    such as better cops and bug fixes.
# 3. Update rubocop, use some of its automated fixes, fix some
#    easy/important ones (especially if they are bugs or security weaknesses),
#    and then disable the rest of the cops (e.g., Enable: false).
#    We can then slowly later try to re-enable some of the newer cops.
# We choose option 3. Later versions of rubocop may add automations,
# so this can save time in both the short and long run.
#
# Rubocop has changed over time:
# * the performance cops were extracted in rubocop-performance
#   and were removed from the main gem in 0.68
# * the Ruby on Rails cops were extracted in rubocop-rails and
#   were removed from the main gem in 0.72
#   Be *sure* to depend on rubocop-rails version *2.0* or later.

# Historical systems could only reliably handle comments if they were ASCII.
# But UTF-8 has essentially "taken over", so there's no reason to limit
# ourselves to ASCII. Having ASCII-only comments makes it unnecessarily
# difficult to discuss/describe locale issues.  *Code* handles UTF-8
# without incident, so there's no reason to limit comments to ASCII.

# The following are newer cops which have disabled because

# Instead, we'll get things running first (ignoring these cops), and
# later try to slowly comply with them or reject them.
# See issue #1069, which tracks this decision.
