# Where reasonable we have tried to keep the test environment
# the *same* as the production environment where it's reasonable to do so;
# every difference can hide a problem from our tests.
# The tests run fast enough as it is, and avoiding problems due to such
# differences is more important. At the least, we're making sure that
# PaperTrail doesn't cause a crash in the various tests, and that's worth
# checking.
