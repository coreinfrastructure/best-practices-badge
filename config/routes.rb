  # The /projects/NUMBER/badge image route needs speed and never uses a

  # change or invalidate a single CDN cache to update a badge image.
  # If we had different routes for each locale, there'd be much
  # more work to change or invalidate them, with no purpose.
  # Therefore, instead of redirecting the badge image to a locale if
  # one is not listed, we do *NOT* support locale URLs in this case.
