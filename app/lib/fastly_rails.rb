# Enable Fastly support from Rails.
# We once used the fastly-rails gem, but that doesn't support Rails 6.
# The fastly (fastly-ruby) gem doesn't support threads (!).
# So we'll just call the purge API directly, as recommended in:
# https://github.com/fastly/fastly-ruby
# See also:
# https://developer.fastly.com/reference/api/purging/
# https://developer.fastly.com/reference/api/auth/

# We could require 'net/http', but that needs more code for HTTPS.
