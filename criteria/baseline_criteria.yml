# Baseline Criteria - Auto-generated from OpenSSF Baseline
#
# This file is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for baseline criteria metadata.
# It contains ALL fields including description and details.
#
# TRANSLATION WORKFLOW:
# - The 'description', 'details', and placeholder fields are automatically
#   extracted to config/locales/en.yml by running: rake baseline:extract_i18n
# - At runtime, the application loads metadata from this file and
#   translatable text from config/locales/*.yml
#
# SYNC PROCESS:
# - This file is generated by: script/extract_baseline.rb
# - After extraction, run: rake baseline:extract_i18n
# - Then run: rake baseline:generate_migration (if new criteria were added)
#
# See docs/baseline_details.md for full documentation.

          the project's authoritative repository, the system MUST require the user
          to complete a multi-factor authentication process.
        details: Enforce multi-factor authentication for the project's version control
          system, requiring collaborators to provide a second form of authentication
          when accessing sensitive data or modifying repository settings. Passkeys
          are acceptable for this control.

          in the project's VCS. Alternatively, use a decentralized approach, like
          the Linux kernel's, where changes are first proposed in another repository,
          and merging changes into the primary repository requires a specific separate
          act.

          could arise within the software. Understanding what threats could be realized
          helps the project manage and address risk. This information is useful to
