  # shown in HTML or the list of users in /users.
  #
  # Some checks (e.g., `can_edit?` or `can_control?`) are pickier and want
  # to ensure that the user is *currently* valid, or want current information
  # about the user (e.g., whether or not the user is an admin).

  # which uses as *input* the instance values that were set here,
  # retrieves this user's data from the database, and
  # memoizes *that* information in `@current_user`.
  # This way, we never query the database unless (1) a user's session claims
  # that the user is logged in, and (2) there's a need for additional info
  # or verification.
