  # Configure Rack::Attack to do rate limiting.

  ### Configure Cache ###

  # If you don't want to use Rails.cache (Rack::Attack's default), then
  # configure it here.
  #
  # Note: The store is only used for throttling (not blacklisting and
  # whitelisting). It must implement .increment and .write like
  # ActiveSupport::Cache::Store

  # Rack::Attack.cache.store = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new

  ### Throttle Spammy Clients ###

  # If any single client IP is making tons of requests, then they're
  # probably malicious or a poorly-configured scraper/spider. Either way, they
  # don't deserve to hog all of the app server's CPU. Cut them off!
  #
  # Note: If you're serving assets through rack, those requests may be
  # counted by rack-attack and this throttle may be activated too
  # quickly. If so, enable the condition to exclude them from tracking.
  # In the case of the BadgeApp, assets are NOT being served via rack.

  # Throttle all requests by IP (default 600/5 minutes, ~120rpm)
  # This *includes* requests for badge images. The default allowed rate
  # is high, because there are circumstances when many badge image requests
  # may be made legitimate. We want *some* limit for absolutely everything,
  # but we need to make that limit high so legimimate requests aren't blocked.
  # As noted above, this limit does NOT apply to static files (like images)
  # in production, as they are served separately.
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:req/ip:#{req.ip}"
  unless Rails.env.test?
    throttle(
      'req/ip',
      limit: (ENV['RATE_REQ_IP_LIMIT'] || 600).to_i,
      period: (ENV['RATE_REQ_IP_PERIOD'] || 5.minutes).to_i
    ) do |req|
      ClientIp.acquire(req) # unless req.path.start_with?('/assets')
    end
  end

  # Path for a badge image. Note that this does NOT vary by locale.
  BADGE_REGEX_PATH = Regexp.compile('^/projects/[1-9][0-9]*/badge$')

  # Throttle all requests other than badge images by IP (default 31/15sec)
  # Everything other than badge image requests should be made at a reasonable
  # rate slower than badge images, so enforce a slower rate.
  # We define a non-badge requests as anything either requesting JSON or
  # not matching the badge path. Allowing badge images to be requested
  # more quickly is not a sercurity issue; badge images
  # are cached by the CDN, are especially fast, and are expected to be
  # requested much more often anyway (e.g., ~30 at time via /projects).
  # As noted above, this limit does NOT apply to static files (like images)
  # in production, as they are served separately.
  # The default is chosen to allow someone to query a single /projects page
  # of 30 projects along with JSON requests for data about every project.
  unless Rails.env.test?
    throttle(
      'nonbadge_req/ip',
      limit: (ENV['NONBADGE_RATE_REQ_IP_LIMIT'] || '31').to_i,

    ) do |req|
      if req.env['HTTP_ACCEPT']&.include?('application/json') ||
         !BADGE_REGEX_PATH.match(req.path)
        ClientIp.acquire(req)
      end
    end
  end

  ### Prevent Brute-Force Login Attacks ###

  # The most common brute-force login attack is a brute-force password
  # attack where an attacker simply tries a large number of emails and
  # passwords to see if any credentials match.
  #
  # Another common method of attack is to use a swarm of computers with
  # different IPs to try brute-forcing a password for a specific account.

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by IP address
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:logins/ip:#{req.ip}"
  unless Rails.env.test?
    throttle(
      'logins/ip',
      limit: (ENV['RATE_LOGINS_IP_LIMIT'] || 20).to_i,
      period: (ENV['RATE_LOGINS_IP_PERIOD'] || 20.seconds).to_i
    ) do |req|
      if LOGIN_PATHS.include?(req.path) && req.post?
        ClientIp.acquire(req)
      end
    end
  end

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by email param
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:logins/email:#{req.email}"
  #
  # Note: This creates a problem where a malicious user could intentionally
  # throttle logins for another user and force their login requests to be
  # denied, but that's not very common and shouldn't happen to you. (Knock
  # on wood!)
  unless Rails.env.test?
    throttle(
      'logins/email',
      limit: (ENV['RATE_LOGINS_EMAIL_LIMIT'] || 5).to_i,
      period: (ENV['RATE_LOGINS_EMAIL_PERIOD'] || 20.seconds).to_i
    ) do |req|
      if LOGIN_PATHS.include?(req.path) && req.post? && req.params['session']
        # return the email to throttle logins on if present, nil otherwise
        req.params['session']['email']
      end
    end
  end

  ### Throttle local signup to /users by IP address
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:signup/ip:#{req.ip}"
  #
  # Limit the number of times an IP address can try to sign up for a local
  # account in a short period of time.  Normal users have no reason to
  # try to create that many different accounts.  We don't need to limit
  # by email address; once an email address has been signed up, it
  # stays that way.
  #
  unless Rails.env.test?
    throttle(
      'signup/ip',
      limit: (ENV['RATE_SIGNUP_IP_LIMIT'] || 20).to_i,
      period: (ENV['RATE_SIGNUP_IP_PERIOD'] || 10.seconds).to_i
    ) do |req|
      if SIGNUP_PATHS.include?(req.path) && req.post?
        ClientIp.acquire(req)
      end
    end
  end

  ### Custom Throttle Response ###

  # By default, Rack::Attack returns an HTTP 429 for throttled responses,
  # which is just fine.
  #
  # If you want to return 503 so that the attacker might be fooled into
  # believing that they've successfully broken your app (or you just want to
  # customize the response), then uncomment these lines.
  # self.throttled_response = lambda do |env|
  #  [ 503,  # status
  #    {},   # headers
  #    ['']] # body
  # end

  ### Block an IP address that is repeatedly making suspicious requests.
  # After FAIL2BAN_MAXRETRY blocked requests in FAIL2BAN_FINDTIME seconds,
  # block all requests from that client IP for FAIL2BAN_BANTIME seconds.
  # A request is blocked if req.path matches the regex FAIL2BAN_PATH or
  # req.query_string matches the regex FAIL2BAN_QUERY.

  # Default regexp for paths to disallow.  Coordinate with "robots.txt"
  # so that we don't ban properly-behaving web crawlers, see:
  # https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/httpd-wordpress-deny

  # We don't need to make this locale-specific, because we'll reject
  # these *before* we hit the "redirect to locale" code.
  # Good attackers will make better attacks than these; the point here
  # is to quickly squelch script kiddies with badly-written/old attacks,
  # so we have more time to deal with other things.
  # "/admin" is a common admin URL. "/wp-" handles attacks on WordPress.
  # "/cgi" includes "cgi-bin", a standard prefix for old-school CGI programs.
  # The pattern near the end that finishes with [%&] is to catch
  # various naive attacks that append nonsense encoded characters after
  # project IDs; we see a lot of these in the wild.
  # (?:...) is a non-capturing regexp group - we don't need to capture this.
