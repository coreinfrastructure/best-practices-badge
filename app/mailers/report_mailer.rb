# When sending emails to specific users we use I18n.with_locale do..end.
# That's because it's possible that the current user is an administrator
# or script, in which case the current I18n.locale is not necessarily
# the recipient's preferred_locale.  Where possible, we want to use
# the recipient's preferred_locale when sending an email.

# We have not internationalized debug/monthly reports, since they are
# only sent in one language anyway (translators have enough work to do,
# let's not ask them to translate unused text!).
