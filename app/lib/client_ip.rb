module ClientIp
  # Compute the correct remote IP address for our environment.
  # We have done tests, and in our current environment this is the
  # always the next-to-last value of the comma-space-separated value
  # "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR" (from the HTTP header X-Forwarded-For).
  # That's because the last value of "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR"
  # is always our CDN (which intercepts it first), and the previous
  # value is set by our CDN to whatever IP address the CDN got.
  # A client can always set X-Forwarded-For and try to spoof something,
  # but those entries are always earlier in the list
  # (so we can easily ignore them).
  # Use correct_remote_ip(req) instead of req.ip.
