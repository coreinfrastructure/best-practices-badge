        The Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)
        Best Practices badge is a way for Free/Libre and
        Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects to
        show that they follow best practices. Projects can voluntarily self-certify,
        at no cost, by using this web application to explain how they follow each
        best practice. The CII Best Practices Badge is inspired by the many badges
        available to projects on GitHub. Consumers of the badge will be able to
        quickly assess which FLOSS projects are following best practices and as a
        result are more likely to produce higher-quality secure software.
