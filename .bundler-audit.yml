  # A vulnerability has been identified in Bootstrap that exposes users
  # to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The issue is present in the
  # carousel component, where the data-slide and data-slide-to attributes
  # can be exploited through the href attribute of an tag due to inadequate
  # sanitization.
  # However, we never use the carousel component, and we strictly restrict
  # the HTML text the user is allowed to insert, so it's not exploitable
  # in our use. More information:
  # https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2

  - CVE-2024-6484

# At one time we ignored CVE-2015-9284 (omniauth), because we mitigated this with a
# third-party countermeasure (omniauth-rails_csrf_protection) in:
# https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/pull/1298
# This is no longer necessary, so we removed that.
