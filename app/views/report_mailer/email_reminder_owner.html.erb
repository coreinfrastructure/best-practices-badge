<h1>Automated Best Practices Badge Reminder for <%= @project.name %></h1>
<p>
This is an automated reminder that your project
"<%= @project.name %>"
does not currently have a "best practices" badge,
and its badge entry has not been updated in a while.
</p>

<p>
Your best practices badge entry is at
<a href="<%= @project_info_url %>"><%= @project_info_url %></a>
and was last updated on <%= @project.updated_at %>.
It is currently at <%= @project.badge_percentage_0 %>% (out of 100%).
</p>

<p>
We encourage you to keep making progress.
Please visit your badge entry at
<a href="<%= @project_info_url %>"><%= @project_info_url %></a>
to complete the information and get your badge!
</p>

<p>
If you want to see <i>only</i> what you're missing, visit your badge entry,
select the button near the top labelled "Expand all panels", and
then select the button near the top labelled "Hide met or N/A criteria".
If you have questions, or need help, please contact
<a href="mailto:&#99;ii&#45;badges&#45;questions&#45;own&#101;r&#64;lists&#46;coreinfrastructure&#46;or&#103;">&#99;ii&#45;badges&#45;questions&#45;own&#101;r&#64;lists&#46;coreinfrastructure&#46;or&#103;</a>
or file an issue at

(click on "new issue").
</p>

<p>
We don't send reminders if you continue to update your badge entry,
and we only send reminders approximately every 30-60 days.  However,
if you want to disable these reminder messages, edit your badge entry at
<a href="<%= @project_info_url %>"><%= @project_info_url %></a>
to turn on "disable inactivity reminder".
We hope you'll instead keep working at it
and eventually earn the badge.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for your time.
