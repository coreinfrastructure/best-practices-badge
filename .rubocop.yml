# Historical systems could only reliably handle comments if they were ASCII.
# But UTF-8 has essentially "taken over", so there's no reason to limit
# ourselves to ASCII. Having ASCII-only comments makes it unnecessarily
# difficult to discuss/describe locale issues.  *Code* handles UTF-8
# without incident, so there's no reason to limit comments to ASCII.

# The following are newer cops which have disabled because
# we aren't ready for them right now. It's diffult to do things "all at once".
# Instead, we'll get things running first (ignoring these cops), and
# later try to slowly comply with them or reject them.
# See issue #1069, which tracks this decision.
