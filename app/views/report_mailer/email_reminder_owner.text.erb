This is an automated reminder that your project
"<%= @project.name %>"
does not currently have a "best practices" badge,
and its badge entry has not been updated in a while.

Your best practices badge entry is at
<%= @project_info_url %>
and was last updated on <%= @project.updated_at %>.
It is currently at <%= @project.badge_percentage %>% (out of 100%).

We encourage you to keep making progress.
Please visit your badge entry at
<%= @project_info_url %>
to complete the information and get your badge!

If you have questions, or need help, please contact
cii-badges-questions-owner@lists.coreinfrastructure.org
or file an issue at
https://github.com/linuxfoundation/cii-best-practices-badge/issues
(click on "new issue").

If you want to disable these reminder messages, edit your badge entry at
<%= @project_info_url %>
to turn on "disable inactivity reminder".
However, we hope you'll instead keep working at it
and eventually earn the badge.

Thank you for your time.
