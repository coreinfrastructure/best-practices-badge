  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created ->
  # highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  root 'static_pages#home'

  # Example of regular route:
  #   get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'

  # Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
  #   get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions
  # automatically):
  #   resources :products

  # Example resource route with options:
  #   resources :products do
  #     member do
  #       get 'short'
  #       post 'toggle'
  #     end
  #
  #     collection do
  #       get 'sold'
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments
  #     resources :sales do
  #       get 'recent', on: :collection
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with concerns:
  #   concern :toggleable do
  #     post 'toggle'
  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end

  # If no route found in some cases, just redirect to a 404 page.
  # The production site is constantly hit by nonsense paths,
  # and while Rails has a built-in mechanism to handle nonsense,
  # Rails' built-in mechanism creates very noisy logs.
  # Ideally we'd redirect all no-match cases quickly to a 404 handler.
  # Unfortunately, the noise-reduction approach for Rails 4 noted here:
  # http://rubyjunky.com/cleaning-up-rails-4-production-logging.html
  # works in development but does NOT work in production.
  # So instead, we'll select a few common cases where we have nothing
  # and there's no possible security problem, and fast-path its rejection
  # by redirecting to a 404 (without a lengthy log of the cause).
  # wp-login.php queries are evidences of WordPress brute-force attacks:
