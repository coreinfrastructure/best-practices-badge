This project identifies best practices for
Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS)
and implements a badging system for those best practices.
The "BadgeApp" badging system is a simple web application
that lets projects self-certify that they meet the criteria
and show a badge.
The real goal of this project is to encourage projects to
apply best practices, and to help users determine which FLOSS projects do so.
We believe that FLOSS projects that implement best practices are more likely
to produce better software, including more secure software.

See the
*[Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) Best Practices badge website](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/)* if you want to try to actually get a badge.

This is the development site for the criteria and badge application
software that runs the website.
Feedback is very welcome via the
[GitHub site](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge)
as issues or pull (merge) requests.
There is also a
[mailing list](https://lists.coreinfrastructure.org/mailman/listinfo/cii-badges)
for general discussion.

## Summary of Best Practices Criteria "passing" level

This is a summary of the passing criteria, with requirements in bold
(for details, see the [full list of criteria](doc/criteria.md)):

  [archived](doc/criteria.md#report_archive)** and
  [tracked](doc/criteria.md#report_tracker):
  - **[Acknowledge](doc/criteria.md#report_responses)**/respond to bugs &
    [enhancement requests](doc/criteria.md#enhancement_responses), rather than
    ignoring them

    [documented process](doc/criteria.md#vulnerability_report_process) for
    reporting vulnerabilities**
  - **[Respond within 14 days](doc/criteria.md#vulnerability_report_response),
    and [fix vulnerabilities](doc/criteria.md#vulnerabilities_critical_fixed),
    [within 60 days if they're public](doc/criteria.md#vulnerabilities_fixed_60_days)**
* **[Have a build that works](doc/criteria.md#build)**, using
  [standard](doc/criteria.md#build_common_tools)
  [open-source](doc/criteria.md#build_floss_tools) tools
  - **Enable (and [fix](doc/criteria.md#warnings_fixed))
    [compiler warnings and lint-like checks](doc/criteria.md#warnings)**
  - **[Run other static analysis tools](doc/criteria.md#static_analysis) and
    [fix exploitable problems](doc/criteria.md#static_analysis_fixed)**
* **[Have an automated test suite](doc/criteria.md#test)** that
  [covers most of the code/functionality](doc/criteria.md#test_most), and
  [officially](doc/criteria.md#tests_documented_added)
  **[require new tests for new code](doc/criteria.md#test_policy)**
* [Automate running the tests on all changes](doc/criteria.md#test_continuous_integration),
  and apply dynamic checks:
  - [Run memory/behaviour analysis tools](doc/criteria.md#dynamic_analysis)
    ([sanitizers/Valgrind](doc/criteria.md#dynamic_analysis_unsafe) etc.)
  - [Run a fuzzer or web-scanner over the code](doc/criteria.md#dynamic_analysis)
* **[Have a developer who understands secure software](doc/criteria.md#know_secure_design)

## Summary of Best Practices Criteria for higher levels

Getting a passing badge is a significant achievement;
on average only about 10% of pursuing projects have a passing badge.
That said, some projects would like to meet even stronger criteria,
and many users would like projects to do so.
We have established two higher levels beyond passing: silver and gold.
The higher levels strengthen some of the passing criteria and add new
criteria of their own.

### Silver

Here is a summary of the silver criteria, with requirements in bold
(for details, see the [full list of silver criteria](doc/other.md)):

* **[Use a DCO or similar](doc/other.md#dco)**
* **[Define/document project governance](doc/other.md#governance)**
* **[Another will have the necessary access rights if someone dies](doc/other.md#access_continuity)**
* *["Bus factor" of 2 or more](doc/other.md#bus_factor)*
* **[Document security requirements](doc/other.md#security_requirements)**
* **[Have an assurance case explaining why security requirements are met](doc/other.md#assurance_case)**
* **[Have a quick start guide](doc/other.md#documentation_quick_start)**
* *[Follow accessibility best practices](doc/other.md#accessibility_best_practices)*
* **[Pick & follow coding standards](doc/other.md#coding_standards)**
* **[Monitor external dependencies to detect/fix known vulnerabilities](doc/other.md#dependency_monitoring)**
* **[Tests have 80%+ statement coverage](doc/other.md#test_statement_coverage80)**
* **[Project releases for widespread use are cryptographically signed](doc/other.md#signed_releases)**
* **[Check all inputs from potentially untrusted sources for validity (using a whitelist)](doc/other.md#input_validation)**
* *[Use hardening mechanisms](doc/other.md#hardening)*

### Gold

Here is a summary of the gold criteria, with requirements in bold
(for details, see the [full list of gold criteria](doc/other.md)):

* **[At least 2 unassociated significant contributors](doc/other.md#contributors_unassociated)**
* **[Per-file copyright and license](doc/other.md#copyright_per_file)**
* **[Use 2FA](doc/other.md#require_2FA)**
