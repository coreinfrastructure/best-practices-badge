    # This is computed entirely using the ActiveRecord query interface
    # as a single select+sort+limit, and not implemented using methods or
    # direct SQL commands. Using the ActiveRecord query interface will turn
    # this directly into a single database request, which will be blazingly
    # fast regardless of the database size (via the indexes). Method
    # invocations would be super-slow, and direct SQL commands will be less
    # portable than ActiveRecord's interface (which works to paper over
    # differences between SQL engines).

    #     (no reminders have been sent), only the other criteria matter.
    #   valid_email = users.encrypted_email (joined) is not null
    #   owner_accepts_emails = users.notification_emails is true
    # Prioritize. Sort by the last_reminder_at datetime
    #   (use updated_at if last_reminder_at is null), oldest first.
    #   Since last_reminder_at gets updated with a newer datetime when
    #   we send a message, each email we send will lower its reminder
    #   priority. Thus we will eventually cycle through all inactive projects
    #   if none of them respond to reminders.
    #   Use: projects.order("COALESCE(last_reminder_at, updated_at)")
    #   We cannot check if email includes "@" here, because they are
    #   encrypted (the database does not have access to the keys, by intent).
    #
    # The "reorder" below uses "Arel.sql" to work around
    # a deprecation warning from Rails 5.2, and
    # is not expected to work in Rails 6.  The warning is as follows:
    # DEPRECATION WARNING: Dangerous query method
    # (method whose arguments are used as raw SQL) called with
    # non-attribute argument(s): "COALESCE(last_reminder_at,
    # projects.updated_at)". Non-attribute arguments will be
    # disallowed in Rails 6.0. This method should not be called with
    # user-provided values, such as request parameters or model
    # attributes. Known-safe values can be passed by wrapping
    # them in Arel.sql().
    # For now we'll wrap them as required.  This is unfortunate; it would
    # dangerous if user-provided data was used, but that is not the case.
    # We're hoping Rails 6 will give us an alternative construct.
    # If not, alternatives include creating a calculated field
    # (e.g., one that does the coalescing).
