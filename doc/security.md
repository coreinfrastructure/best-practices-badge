# Security

<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: (MIT OR CC-BY-3.0+) -->

Security is important and challenging.
This document describes why we think this software (the "BadgeApp")
is adequately secure (i.e., its "assurance case").

Sadly, perfection is rare; we really want your help.
If you find a vulnerability, please see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to submit a vulnerability report.
For more technical information on the implementation, see
[implementation.md](implementation.md).

The following figures summarize why we think this application
is adequately secure:

![Assurance case summary](./assurance-case.png)
![Assurance case in lifecycle](./assurance-case-lifecycle.png)
![Assurance case in implementation](./assurance-case-implementation.png)

These figures are in Claims, Arguments and Evidence (CAE) notation,
which is a simple notation often used for assurance cases.
Ovals are claims or sub-claims, while rounded rectangles are the supporting
arguments justifying the claims.
The figures are simply a summary; the text below provides the details.

Our overall security approach is called
defense-in-breadth, that is, we consider
security (including security countermeasures) in all
our software development processes (including
requirements, design, implementation, verification, and reuse from
external suppliers).
In each software development process we
identify the specific issues that most need to be addressed,
and then address them.

We do *not* use a waterfall model for software development.
It's important to note that when we use the word *process* it
has a completely different meaning from a *phase*.
Instead, we use the word "process" with its standard meaning in
software and systems engineering, that is,
a "process" is just a "set of interrelated or interacting activities
which transforms inputs into outputs" (ISO ISO 9000:2005, quoted in
ISO/IEEE 12207:2008).
In a waterfall model, these processes are done to completion
in a strict sequence of phases (where each phase occurs for some
period of time).
That is, you create all of the requirements in
one phase, then do all the design in the next phase, and so on.
Winston Royce's paper "Managing the Development of Large Software Systems"
(1970) notes that in software development this naive waterfall approach
"is risky and invites failure" - in practice
"design iterations are never confined to the successive steps".
We obviously *do* determine what the software will do differently
(requirements), as well as design, implement, and verify it, so we
certainly do have these processes.
However, as with almost all real software development projects,
we perform these processes in parallel, iterating and
feeding back as appropriate.
Each process is (notionally) run in parallel;
each receives inputs and produces outputs.

Below are the overall security requirements, followed by how we approach
security in the rest of the software development processes:
design, implementation,
verification, supply chain (reuse), and deployment/operations.
This is followed by a discussion about security in the
development environment and our people.
Note that the project receives its own badge
(the CII best practices badge),
which provides additional evidence that it applies best practices
that can lead to more secure software.

## Security Requirements

## Basic Security Requirements and Assets

Here is what BadgeApp must do to be secure (and a few comments about
how we implement these requirements):

* Confidentiality:
    - Almost all data we collect is considered public, e.g., all project data,
      who owns the project information, and GitHub user names,
      so we don't need to keep those confidential.
    - Non-public data is kept confidential.
      User passwords and user email addresses are non-public data.
      We *do* consider them higher-value assets and protect specially:
        - User passwords are only stored on the server as
          iterated salted hashes (using bcrypt).
        - Users may choose to "remember me" to automatically re-login on
          that specific browser if they use a local account.
          This is implemented using a
          cryptographically random nonce stored in the user's cookie store
          which acts like a password, which is verified against a
          remember_digest value stored in the server
          that is an iterated salted hash (using bcrypt).
          This "remember me" functionality cannot reveal the user's
          original password, and if the server's user database is
          compromised an attacker cannot easily find the nonce.
          The nonce is protected in transit by HTTPS (discussed elsewhere).
          The user_id stored by the user is signed by the server.
          As with any system, the "remember me" functionality has a
          weakness: if the user's system is compromised, others can log
          in as that user.  But this is fundamental to any "remember me"
          functionality, and users must opt in to enable "remember me"
          (by default users must enter their password on each login).
          The "remember me" box was originally implemented
          in commit e79decec67.
        - Email addresses are only revealed to the logged-in owner and
          administrators. We do store email addresses;
          we need those for various purposes
          (e.g., contact badge entry owners for clarification).
          We also user email addresses as the user id for "local" accounts.
          We strive to not reveal user email addresses to others
          (with the exception of administrators, who are trusted and thus
          can see them).  Most of the rest of this document describes the
          measures we take to prevent turning unintentional mistakes
          into exposures of this data.
        - HTTPS is used to encrypt all communications between users
          and the application; this protects the confidentiality of
          all data in motion.
          There's no need to worry about covert channels.
* Integrity:
    - HTTPS is used to protect the integrity of all communications between
      users and the application, as well as to authenticate the server
      to the user.
    - Edits require a logged-in user with authorization.
      Edits may be performed by the data owner, anyone GitHub reports as
      being authorized to edit the project (if it's on GitHub), or
      a BadgeApp administrator ("admin").
      The badge owner is whoever created the badge entry.
    - Modifications to the official BadgeApp application require
      authentication via GitHub.
      We use GitHub for managing the source code and issue tracker; it
      has an authentication system for this purpose.
* Availability:
    - As with any publicly-accessible website,
      we cannot prevent someone with significant
      resources from overwhelming the system.
      (This includes DDoS attacks,
      since someone who controls many clients controls a lot of resources.)
      So instead, we focus on various kinds of resilience.
      See the design section "availability through scaleability" below
      for more about how we handle scaling up.
    - We use a cloud and CDN deployment, which allows quick scale-up
      of resources when necessary.
    - All queries, including project data queries, have a timeout.
      That way, the system is not permanently "stuck" on a request.
    - The system can return to operation quickly after
      a DDoS attack has ended.
    - We routinely backup the database and retain multiple versions.
      That way, if the project data is corrupted, we can restore the
      database to a previous state.

BadgeApp must avoid being taken over by attackers, since this
could cause lead to failure in confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
In addition, it must avoid being a conduit for others' attacks
(e.g., not be vulnerable to cross-site scripting).
We do this by focusing on having a secure design and countering the
most common kinds of attacks (as described below).

## Threat Agents

We have few insiders, and they are fully trusted to *not*
perform intentionally-hostile actions.

Thus, the threat agents we're primarily concerned about are outsiders,
and the most concerning ones fit in one of these categories:

*  people who enjoy taking over systems (without monetary benefit)
*  criminal organizations who want to take emails and/or passwords
   as a way to take over others' accounts (to break confidentiality).
   Note that our one-way iterated salted hashes counter easy access
   to passwords, so the most sensitive data is more difficult to obtain.
*  criminal organizations who want destroy all our data and hold it for
   ransom (i.e., "ransomware" organizations).  Note that our backups
   help counter this.

Criminal organizations may try to DDoS us for money, but there's no
strong reason for us to pay the extortion fee.
We expect that people will be willing to come back to the site later
if it's down, and we have scaleability countermeasures to reduce their
effectivenes.  If the attack is ongoing, several of the services we use
would have a finantial incentive to help us counter the attacks.
This makes the attacks themselves less likely
(since there would be no financial benefit to them).

There's no reason a state actor would attack the site
(we don't store anything that valuable), so while many are very capable,
we do not expect them to be a threat to this site.

## Other Notes on Security Requirements

Here are a few other notes about the security requirements.

It is difficult to implement truly secure software.
One challenge is that BadgeApp must accept, store, and retrieve data from
untrusted (non-admin) users.
In addition, BadgeApp must also go out
to untrusted websites with untrusted contents,
using URLs provided by untrusted users,
to gather data about those projects (so it can automatically fill in data).
By "untrusted" we mean sites that might attempt to attack BadgeApp, e.g.,
by providing malicious data or by being unresponsive.
We have taken a number of steps to reduce the likelihood
of vulnerabilities, and to reduce the impact of vulnerabilities
where they exist.
In particular, retrieval of external information is subject to a timeout,
we use Ruby (a memory-safe language),
and exceptions halt automated processing for that entry (which merely
disables automated data gathering for that entry).

The permissions system is intentionally simple.
Every user has an account, either a 'local' account or an external
system account (currently we support GitHub as an external account).
Anyone can create an account.
A user with role='admin' is an administator;
few users are administrators.
A user can create as many project entries as desired.
Each project entry gets a new unique project id and is
owned by the user who created the project entry.
A project entry can only be edited (and deleted) by the entry creator,
an administrator, or by others who can prove that they
can edit that GitHub repository (if it is on GitHub).
Anyone can see the project entry results once they are saved.
We do require, in the case of a GitHub project entry, that the
entry creator be logged in via GitHub *and* be someone who can edit that
project.
We may in the future add support for groups (e.g., where the owner
can designate other users who can edit that entry) and
a way for others to edit project entries when they are not on GitHub.

Here we have identified the key security requirements and why we believe
they've been met overall.  However, there is always the possibility that
a mistake could lead to failure to meet these requirements.
We manage this risk by
implementing security in all our software development processes.
We also protect our development environment and choose people
who will help support this.
The following sections describe how we've managed this risk.

## Security in Design

We emphasize security in design by using a simple design,
applying secure design principles,
limiting memory-unsafe language use, and
increasing availability through scaleability.

See the [implementation][./implementation.md] file to
see a more detailed discussion of the software design, including a
diagram of its high-level architecture and its trust boundary.

### <a name="simple-design"></a>Simple design

This web application has a simple design.
It is a standard Ruby on Rails design with models, views, and controllers.
In production it is accessed via a web server (Puma) and
builds on a relational database database system (PostgreSQL).
The software is multi-process and is intended to be multi-threaded
(see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more about this).
The database system itself is trusted, and the database managed
by the database system is not directly accessible by untrusted users.
The application runs on Linux kernel and uses some standard operating system
facilities and libraries (e.g., to provide TLS).
All interaction between the users and the web application go over
an encrypted channel using TLS.
There is some JavaScript served to the client,
but no security decisions depend on code that runs on the client.

The custom code has been kept as small as possible, in particular, we've
tried to keep it DRY (don't repeat yourself).

From a user's point of view,
users potentially create an id, then log in and enter data
about projects (as new or updated data).
Users can log in using a local account or by using their GitHub account.
Non-admin users are not trusted.
The entry of project data (and potentially periodically) triggers
an evaluation of data about the project, which automatically fills in
data about the project.
Projects that meet certain criteria earn a badge, which is displayed
by requesting a specific URL.
A "Chief" class and "Detective" classes attempt to get data about a project
and analyze that data; this project data is also untrusted
(in particular, filenames, file contents, issue tracker information and
contents, etc., are all untrusted).

### Secure design principles

Applying various secure design principles helps us avoid
security problems in the first place.
The most widely-used list of security design principles, and
one we build on, is the list developed by
[Saltzer and Schroeder](http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/).

Here are a number of secure design principles and how we follow them,
including all 8 principles from
[Saltzer and Schroeder](http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/):

* Economy of mechanism (keep the design as simple and small as practical,
  e.g., by adopting sweeping simplifications).
  We discuss this in more detail in the section
  "[simple design](#simple-design)".
* Fail-safe defaults (access decisions should deny by default):
  Access decisions are deny by default.
* Complete mediation (every access that might be limited must be
  checked for authority and be non-bypassable):
  Every access that might be limited is checked for authority and
  non-bypassable.  Security checks are in the controllers, not the router,
  because multiple routes can lead to the same controller
  (this is per Rails security guidelines).
  When entering data, JavaScript code on the client shows whether or not
  the badge has been achieved, but the client-side code is *not* the
  final authority (it's merely a convenience).  The final arbiter of
  badge acceptance is server-side code, which is not bypassable.
* Open design (security mechanisms should not depend on attacker
  ignorance of its design, but instead on more easily protected and
  changed information like keys and passwords):
  The entire program is open source software and subject to inspection.
  Keys are kept in separate files not included in the public repository.
* Separation of privilege (multi-factor authentication,
  such as requiring both a password and a hardware token,
  is stronger than single-factor authentication):
  We don't use multi-factor authentication because the risks from compromise
  are smaller compared to many other systems
  (it's almost entirely public data, and failures generally can be recovered
  through backups).
* Least privilege (processes should operate with the
  least privilege necesssary): The application runs as a normal user,
  not a privileged user like "root".  It must have read/write access to
  its database, so it has that privilege.
* Least common mechanism (the design should minimize the mechanisms
  common to more than one user and depended on by all users,
  e.g., directories for temporary files):
  No shared temporary directory is used.  Each time a new request is made,
  new objects are instantiated; this makes the program generally thread-safe
  as well as minimizing mechanisms common to more than one user.
  The database is shared, but each table row has access control implemented
  which limits sharing to those authorized to share.
* Psychological acceptability
  (the human interface must be designed for ease of use,
  designing for "least astonishment" can help):
  The application presents a simple login and "fill in the form"
  interface, so it should be acceptable.
* Limited attack surface (the attack surface, the set of the different
  points where an attacker can try to enter or extract data, should be limited):
  The application has a limited attack surface.
  As with all Ruby on Rails applications, all access must go through the
  router to the controllers; the controllers then check for access permission.
  There are few routes, and few controller methods are publicly accessible.
  The underlying database is configured to *not* be publicly accessible.
  Many of the operations use numeric ids (e.g., which project), which are
  simply numbers (limiting the opportunity for attack because numbers are
  trivial to validate).
* Input validation with whitelists
  (inputs should typically be checked to determine if they are valid
  before they are accepted; this validation should use whitelists
  (which only accept known-good values),
  not blacklists (which attempt to list known-bad values)):
  In data provided directly to the web application,
  input validation is done with whitelists through controllers and models.
  Parameters are first checked in the controllers using the Ruby on Rails
  "strong parameter" mechanism, which ensures that only a whitelisted set
  of parameters are accepted at all.
  Once the parameters are accepted, Ruby on Rails'
  [active record validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html)
  are used.
  All project parameters are checked by the model, in particular,
  status values (the key values used for badges) are checked against
  a whitelist of values allowed for that criterion.
  There are a number of freetext fields (name, license, and the
  justifications); since they are freetext these are the hardest
  to whitelist.
  That said, we even impose restrictions on freetext, in particular,
  they must be valid UTF-8, they must not include control characters
  (other than \\n and \\r), and they have maximum lengths.
  These checks by themselves cannot counter certain attacks;
  see the text on security in implementation for the discussion on
  how this application counters SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks.
  URLs are also limited by length and a whitelisted regex, which counters
  some kinds of attacks.
  When project data (new or edited) is provided, all proposed status values
  are checked to ensure they are one of the legal criteria values for
  that criterion (Met, Unmet, ?, or N/A depending on the criterion).
  Once project data is received, the application tries to get some
  values from the project itself; this data may be malevolent, but the
  application is just looking for the presence or absence of certain
  data patterns, and never executes data from the project.

### Availability through scaleability

Availability is, as always, especially challenging.
Our primary approach is to ensure that the design scales.

As a Ruby on Rails application, it is designed so each request can
be processed separately on separate processes.
We use the 'puma' web server to serve multiple processes
(so attackers must have many multiple simultaneous requests to keep
them all busy),
and timeouts are used (once a request times out, the process is
automatically killed and the server can process a new request).
The system is designed to be easily scalable (just add more worker
processes), so we can quickly purchase additional computing resources
to handle requests if needed.

The system is currently deployed to Heroku, which imposes a hard
time limit for each request; thus, if a request gets stuck
(say during autofill by a malevolent actor who responds slowly),
eventually the timeout will cause the response to stop and the
system will become ready for another request.

We use a Content Delivery Network (CDN), specifically Fastly,
to provide cached values of badges.
These are the most resource-intense kind of request.
As long as the CDN is up, even if the application crashes the
then-current data will stay available until the system recovers.

A determined attacker with significant resources could disable the
system through a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.
However, this site doesn't have any particular political agenda,
and taking it down is unlikely to provide monetary gain.
Thus, this site doesn't seem as likely a target for a long-term DDoS
attack, and there is not much else we can do to counter DDoS
by an attacker with signficant resources.

### Memory-safe languages

All the code we have written (aka the custom code)
is written in memory-safe languages
(Ruby and JavaScript), so the vulnerabilities of memory-unsafe
languages (such as C and C++) cannot occur in the custom code.
This also applies to most of the code in the directly depended libraries.

Some lower-level reused components (e.g., the operating system kernel,
database management system, encryption library, and some of the Ruby gems)
do have C/C++, but these are widely used components where we have
good reason to believe that developers are directly working to mitigate
the problems from memory-unsafe languages.
See the section below on supply chain (reuse) for more.

## Security in Implementation

Most implementation vulnerabilities are due to common types
of implementation errors or common misconfigurations,
so countering them greatly reduces security risks.

To reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities in implementation we
have focused on countering the
[OWASP Top 10 (2013)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10).
To counter common misconfigurations, we apply the
[Ruby on Rails Security Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html).
We have also taken steps to harden the application.
Below is how we've done each, in turn.

### Common implementation vulnerability types countered (OWASP top 10)

The
[OWASP Top 10 (2013)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10)
([details](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project))
represents "a broad consensus about what the most
critical web application security flaws are."
We address all of them.  By ensuring that we address all of them,
we address all of the most critical and common flaws for
this we application.

Here are the OWASP top 10
and how we attempt to reduce their risks in BadgeApp.

1. Injection.
   BadgeApp is implemented in Ruby on Rails, which has
   built-in protection against SQL injection.  SQL commands are not used
   directly, instead Rails includes Active Record, which implements an
   Object Relational Mapping (ORM) with parameterized commands.
   SQL commands are never issued directly by the custom code.
   The shell is not used to download or process file contents (e.g., from
   repositories), instead, various Ruby APIs acquire and process it directly.
2. Broken Authentication and Session Management.
   Sessions are created and destroyed through a common
   Rails mechanism, including an encrypted and signed cookie session key.
3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
   We use Rails' built-in XSS
   countermeasures, in particular, its "safe" HTML mechanisms such
   as SafeBuffer.  By default, Rails always applies HTML escapes
   on strings displayed through views unless they are marked as safe.
   [SafeBuffers and Rails 3.0](http://yehudakatz.com/2010/02/01/safebuffers-and-rails-3-0/)
   discusses this in more detail.
   This greatly reduces the risk of mistakes leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
   In addition, we use a restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP).
   Our CSP, for example, tells web browsers to not execute any JavaScript
   included in HTML (JavaScript must be in separate JavaScript files).
   This makes limits damage even if an attacker gets something into
   the generated HTML.
4. Insecure Direct Object References.
   The only supported direct object references are for publicly available
   objects (stylesheets, etc.).
   All other requests go through routers and controllers,
   which determine what may be accessed.
5. Security Misconfiguration.
   See the section on [countering misconfiguration](#misconfiguration).
6. Sensitive Data Exposure.
   We generally do not store sensitive data; most of the data about projects
   is intended to be public.  We do store email addresses, and work to
   prevent them from exposure.
   The local passwords are potentially the most sensitive; stolen passwords
   allow others to masquerade as that user, possibly on other sites
   if the user reuses the password on other sites.
   Local passwords are encrypted with bcrypt
   (this is a well-known iterated salted hash algorithm) using a per-user salt.
   We use HTTPS to establish an encrypted link between the server and users,
   to prevent sensitive data (like passwords) from being disclosed in motion.
7. Missing Function Level Access Control.
   The system depends on server-side routers and controllers for
   access control.  There is some client-side JavaScript, but no
   access control depends on it.
8. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
   We use the built-in Rails CSRF countermeasure, where csrf tokens
   are included in replies and checked on POST inputs.
   We also set cookies with SameSite=Lax, which automatically counters
   CSRF on supported browsers (such as Chrome).
   Our restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP) helps here, too.
   For more information, see the page on
   [request forgery protection](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/RequestForgeryProtection.html).
9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities.
   We detect components with publicly known vulnerabilities
   using bundle-audit and gemnasium.
   These use the Gemfile* and National Vulnerability Database (NVD) data.
   For more information, see the "[supply chain](#supply-chain)" section.
10. Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards.
   Redirects and forwards are used sparingly, and they are validated.

### <a name="misconfiguration"></a>Common misconfiguration errors countered: Ruby on Rails Security Guide

A common security problem with applications is misconfiguration;
here is how we reduce the risks from misconfiguration.

We take a number of steps to counter misconfiguration.
We have strived to enable secure defaults from the start.
We use a number of [external online checkers](#online-checkers)
to detect common HTTPS misconfiguration problems (see below).
We use brakeman, which can detect
some misconfigurations in Rails applications.
Brakeman is invoked by the default 'rake' task,
and our continuous integration task reruns brakeman.

However, our primary mechanism for countering misconfigurations is by
identifying and apply ing the most-relevant security guide available.

This entire application is built on Ruby on Rails.
The Ruby on Rails developers provide a
[Ruby on Rails Security Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html),
which identifies what they believe are the most important areas to
check for securing such applications.
Since this guide is focused on the infrastructure we use, we think this is
the most important guide for us to focus on.

We apply the entire guide.
Here is a discussion on how we apply the entire guide, per its chapters
as of 2015-12-14:

1. *Introduction.* N/A.
2. *Sessions.*
   We use sessions, and use session cookies to store them
   because of their wide support and efficiency.
   We use the default Rails CookieStore mechanism to store sessions;
   it is both simple and much faster than alternatives.
   Rails implements an automatic authentication mechanism (using a
   secret key) to ensure that clients cannot undetectably change
   these cookies; a changed value is thrown away.
   Logged-in users have their user id stored in this authenticated cookie
   (There is also a session_id, not currently used.)
   Session data is intentionally kept small, because of the limited
   amount of data available in a cookie.
   To counteract session hijacking, we configure the production
   environment to always communicate over an enrypted channel using TLS
   (see file config/environments/production.rb which sets
   "config.force_ssl" to true).
   The design allows users to drop cookies at any time
   (at worse they may have to re-login to get another session cookie).
   One complaint about Rails' traditional CookieStore is that if someone
   gets a copy of a session cookie, they can log in as that user, even
   if the cookie is years old and the user logged out.
   (e.g., because someone got a backup copied).
   Our countermeasure is to time out inactive sessions, by
   also storing a time_last_used in the session
   cookie (the UTC time the cookie was last used).
   Once the time expires, then even if someone else later gets an old
   cookie value, it cannot be used to log into the system.
3. *Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).*
   We use the standard REST operations with their standard meanings
   (GET, POST, etc., with the standard Rails method workaround).
   We have a CSRF required security token implemented using
   protect_from_forgery built into the application-wide controller
   app/controllers/application_controller.rb
   (we do not use cookies.permanent or similar, a contra-indicator).
4. *Redirection and Files.*
   The application uses relatively few redirects; those that do involve
   the "id", which only works if it can find the value corresponding to
   the id first (which is a whitelist).
   File uploads aren't directly supported; the application does
   temporarily load some files (as part of autofill), but those filenames
   and contents are not directly made available to any other user
   (indeed, they're thrown away once autofill completes; caching may
   keep them, but that simply allows re-reading of data already acquired).
   The files aren't put into a filesystem, so there's no
   opportunity for executable code to be put into the filesystem this way.
   There is no arbitrary file downloading capability, and private files
   (e.g., with keys) are not in the docroot.
5. *Intranet and Admin Security.*
   Some users have 'admin' privileges, but these additional privileges
   simply let them edit other project records.
   Any other direct access requires logging in to the production system
   through a separate log in (e.g., to use 'rails console').
   Indirect access (e.g., to update the code the site runs)
   requires separately logging into
   GitHub and performing a valid git push (this must also pass through the
   continuous integration test suite).
   It's possible to directly push to the Heroku sites to deploy software,
   but this requires the credentials for directly logging into the
   relevant tier (e.g., production), and only authorized system administrators
   have those credentials.
6. *User management.*
   Local passwords have a minimum length (8) and cannot be
   a member of a set of known-bad passwords.  We allow much longer passwords.
   This complies with draft NIST Special Publication 800-63B,
   "Digital Authentication Guideline: Authentication and Lifecycle Management"
   dated Thu, 24 Nov 2016 08:15:51 -0500 <https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/>.
   We expect users to
   protect their own passwords; we do not try to protect users from themselves.
   The system is not fast enough for a naive password-guesser to succeed
   guessing local passwords via network access (unless the password
   is really bad).
   The forgotten-password system for local accounts
   uses email; that has its weaknesses,
   but the data is sufficiently low value, and there aren't
   good alternatives for low value data like this.
   This isn't as bad as it might appear, because we prefer encrypted
   channels for transmitting all emails. Our application attempts to send
   messages to its MTA using TLS (using enable_starttls_auto: true),
   and that MTA (SendGrid) then attempts to transfer the email the rest
   of the way using TLS if the recipient's email system supports it
   (see <https://sendgrid.com/docs/Glossary/tls.html>).
   Many widely-used
   This is decent protection against passive attacks.
   If users don't like that, they can log in via GitHub and use GitHub's
   forgotten password system.
   The file config/initializers/filter_parameter_logging.rb
   intentionally filters passwords so that they are not included in the log.
   We require that local user passwords have a minimum length
   (see the User model), and this is validated by the server
   (in some cases the minimum length is also checked by the web client,
   but this is not depended on).
   Ruby's regular expression (regex) language oddly interprets "^" and "$",
   which can lead to defects (you're supposed to use \A and \Z instead).
   However, Ruby's format validator and the "brakeman" tool both detect
   this common mistake with regexes, so this should be unlikely.
   Since the project data is public, manipulating the 'id' cannot reveal
   private public data.  We don't consider the list of valid users
   private either, so again, manipulating 'id' cannot reveal anything private.
7. *Injection.*
   We use whitelists to validate project data entered into the system.
   When acquiring data from projects during autofill, we do only for the
   presence or absence of patterns; the data is not stored (other than caching)
   and the data is not used in command interpreters (such as SQL or shell).
   SQL injection is countered by Rails' built-in database query mechanisms,
   we primarily use specialized routines like find() that counter
   SQL injection, but parameterized queries are also allowed
   (and also counter SQL injection).
   XSS, CSS injection, and Ajax injection are
   countered using Rails' HTML sanitization
   (by default strings are escaped when generating HTML).
   The program doesn't call out ot the command line or use a routine
   that directly does so, e.g., there's no call
   to system()... so command injection won't work either.
   The software resists header injection including response splitting;
   headers are typically not dynamicaly generated, most redirections
   (using redirect_to) are to static locations, and the rest are based
   on filtered locations.
   We use a restrictive CSP setting to limit damage if all those fail.
8. *Unsafe Query Generation.*
   We use the default Rails behavior, in particular, we leave
   deep_munge at its default value (which counters a number of vulnerabilities).
9. *Default Headers.*
   We use at least the default security HTTP headers,
   which help counter some attacks.
   We harden the headers further, in particular via the
   [secure_headers](https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders) gem.
   For example, we use a restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP) header.
   For more information, see the hardening section.

### Hardening

We also use various mechanisms to harden the system against attack;
these attempt to thwart or slow attack even if the system has a vulnerability.

* We harden the HTTP headers, including the use of a
  restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP) header with just
  "normal sources" (normal_src).
  CSP is perhaps one of the most important hardening items,
  since it prevents execution of injected JavaScript).
  The HTTP headers are hardened via the
  [secure_headers](https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders) gem,
  developed by Twitter to enable a number of HTTP headers for hardening.
* Cookies have various restrictions (also via the
  [secure_headers](https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders) gem).
  They have httponly=true (which counters many JavaScript-based attacks),
  secure=true (which is irrelevant because we always use HTTPS but it
  can't hurt), and SameSite=Lax (which counters CSRF attacks on
  web browsers that support it).
* We force the use of HTTPS, including via HSTS.
  The "coreinfrastructure.org" domain is included in
  [Chrome's HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) preload list](https://hstspreload.org/?domain=coreinfrastructure.org).
  This is a list of sites that are hardcoded into Chrome as being HTTPS only
  (some other browsers also use this list), so in many cases browsers
  will automatically use HTTPS (even if HTTP is requested).
  If the web brower uses HTTP anyway,
  our CDN (Fastly) is configured to redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
  If our CDN is misconfigured or skipped for some reason, the application
  will also redirect the user from HTTP to HTTPS if queried directly.
  This is because in production "config.force_ssl" is set to true,
  which enables a number of hardening mechanisms in Rails, including
  TLS redirection (which redirects HTTP to HTTPS), secure cookies,
  and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
  HSTS tells browsers to always use HTTPS in the future for this site,
  so once the user contacts the site once, it will use HTTPS in the future.
  See
  ["Rails, Secure Cookies, HSTS and friends" by Ilija Eftimov (2015-12-14)](http://eftimov.net/rails-tls-hsts-cookies)
  for more about the impact of force_ssl.
* We enable per-form CSRF tokens, a Rails 5 addition.
  (Rails.application.config.action_controller.per_form_csrf_tokens)
* We enable origin-checking CSRF mitigation, a Rails 5 addition.
  (Rails.application.config.action_controller.forgery_protection_origin_check)
* We enable rate limits on reminder emails.
  We send reminder emails to projects that have not updated their
  badge entry in a long time. The detailed algorithm that prioritizes projects
  is in "app/models/project.rb" class method "self.projects_to_remind".
  It sorts by reminder date, so we always cycle through before returning to
  a previously-reminded project.  We have a hard rate limit on the number
  of emails we will send out each time; this keeps us from looking like
  a spammer.

## <a name="supply-chain"></a>Supply chain (reuse)

Like all modern software, we reuse components developed by others.
We can't eliminate all risks, and
if we rewrote all the software (instead of reusing software)
we would risk creating vulnerabilities in own code.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more about how we
reduce the risks of reused code.

### Review before use

We consider the code we reuse
(e.g., libraries and frameworks) before adding them, to reduce
the risk of unintentional and intentional vulnerabilities from them.
In particular, we prefer the use of popular components (where problems
are more likely to be identified and addressed).
In some cases we review the code ourselves.

We require that all components that are *required* for use
have FLOSS licenses.  This enables review by us and by others.

We prefer common FLOSS licenses.
A FLOSS component with a rarely-used license, particularly a
GPL-incompatible one, is less likely to be reviewed by others because
in most cases fewer people will contribute to it.

We use license_finder to ensure that the licenses are what we expect,
and that the licenses do not change to something unexpected later
in later versions.

### Auto-detect vulnerabilities when publicly reported (and speedily respond)

We have a process for automatically detecting when the components we use
have publicly known vulnerabilities or are out-of-date, and
can quickly respond to alerts that there are publicly known
vulnerabilities.
We specifically focus on detecting all components with any publicly known
vulnerability, both in our direct and indirect dependencies.

The list of libraries used (transitively) is managed by bundler, so
updating libraries or sets of libraries can be done quickly.
As noted earlier, our strong automated test suite makes it easy to test this
updated set, so we can rapidly update libraries, test the result, and
deploy it.

We detect components with publicly known vulnerabilities
using both bundle-audit and gemnasium.
These use the Gemfile* files and National Vulnerability Database (NVD) data:

* bundle-audit compares the entire set of gems (libraries),
  both direct and indirect dependencies, to a database
  of versions with known vulnerabilities.
  This is a more complete analysis compared to Gemnasium.
  The default 'rake' task invokes bundle-audit, so every time we run
  "rake" we are alerted about publicly known vulnerabilities in the
  components we depend on (directly or not).
* Gemnasium warns us when there are vulnerable or
  out-of-date direct dependencies.  Gemnasium only looks at the
  direct dependencies (Gemfile, not Gemfile.lock).
  The BadgeApp Gemnasium badge provides a quick view of the
  current state, and links to the
  [Badgeapp Gemnasium page](https://gemnasium.com/linuxfoundation/cii-best-practices-badge)
  for more information.

We have also optimized the component update process through
using the package manager (bundler) and high test coverage.
The files Gemfile and Gemfile.lock
identify the current versions of Ruby gems (Gemfile identifies direct
dependencies; Gemfile.lock includes all transitive dependencies and
the exact version numbers).  We can rapidly update libraries by
updating those files, running "bundle install", and then using "rake"
to run various automated checks including a robust test suite.
Once those pass, we can immediately field the results.

This approach is known to work.
Commit fdb83380aa71352
on 2015-11-26 updated nokogiri, in response to a bundle-audit
report on advisory CVE-2015-1819, "Nokogiri gem contains
several vulnerabilities in libxml2 and libxslt".
When it was publicly reported we were alerted.
In less than an hour from the time the vulnerability
was publicly reported we were alerted,
updated the library, ran the full test suite, and deployed the fixed version.

### MITM countered when obtaining reused components

We counter man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks when downloading gems
because the Gemfile configuration uses an HTTPS source to the
standard place for loading gems (<https://rubygems.org>).

## Security in Verification

When software is modified, it is reviewed by the
'rake' process, which performs a number of checks and tests.
Modifications integrated into the master branch
are further automatically checked.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

The following is a brief summary of part of our verification process,
and how it helps make the software more secure:

* Style checking tools.
  We intentionally make the code relatively short and clean to ease review
  by both humans and other tools.
  We use rubocop (a Ruby code style checker), rails_best_practices
  (a style checker specific to Rails), and ESLint
  (a style checker for JavaScript).
  We work to have no warnings in the code,
  typically by fixing the problem, though in some cases we will annotate
  in the code that we're allowing an exception.
  These style tools help us avoid more problematic constructs (in some cases
  avoiding defects that might lead to vulnerabilities), and
  also make the code easier to review
  (by both humans and other programs).
  Our style checking tools detect misleading indentation;
  <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/apple-goto-fail.html#indentation">this
  counters the mistake in the Apple goto fail vulnerability</a>.
* Security vulnerability scanner (for finding new vulnerabilities).
  We use brakeman, a static source code analyzer that focuses
  on finding security issues in Ruby on Rails applications.
  Note that this is separate from the automatic detection of
  third-party components with publicly-known vulnerabilities;
  see the [supply chain](#supply-chain) section for how we counter those.
* FLOSS.  Reviewability is important for security.
  All the required reused components are FLOSS, and our
  custom software is released as Free/Libre and open source software (FLOSS)
  using a well-known FLOSS license (MIT).
* The software has a strong test suite; our policy requires
  at least 90% statement coverage (and in practice our coverage is higher).
  This makes it easier to update components (e.g., if a third-party component
  has a publicly disclosed vulnerability).
  The test suite also makes it easier to make other fixes (e.g., to harden
  something) and have fairly high
  confidence that the change did not break functionality.
  It can also counter some vulnerabilities, e.g.,
  <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/apple-goto-fail.html#coverage">Apple's
  goto fail vulnerability would have been detected had they
  checked statement coverage</a>.

We have briefly experimented with using the "dawnscanner" security scanner.
We have decided to *not* add dawnscanner to the set of scanners that we
routinely use, because it doesn't really add any value in our particular
situation.
See the [dawnscanner.md](./dawnscanner.md) file for more information.

These steps cannot *guarantee* that there are no vulnerabilities,
but we think they greatly reduce the risks.

## Deployment and operations

To be secure, the software has to be secure as actually deployed.
Our deployment provider takes steps to be secure.
Online checkers of our deployed site suggest that we have
a secure site.
In addition, we have detection and recovery processes
that help us limit damage.

### Deployment provider

We deploy via a cloud provider who takes a number of steps
to keep our system secure.
We currently use Heroku for deployment; see the
[Heroku security policy](https://www.heroku.com/policy/security)
for some information on how they manage security
(including physical security and environmental safeguards).
Normal users cannot directly access the database management system (DBMS),
which on the production system is Postgres.
Anyone can create a Heroku application and run it on Heroku, however,
at that point we trust the Postgres developers and the Heroku administrators
to keep the databases separate.

People can log in via GitHub accounts; in those cases we depend
on GitHub to correctly authenticate users.
[GitHub takes steps to keep itself secure](https://help.github.com/articles/github-security/).

### <a name="online-checkers"></a>Online checkers

Various online checkers give us an overall clean bill of health.
Most of the checkers test our HTTPS (TLS) configuration and
if common hardening mechanisms are enabled.

For the main bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org site we have:

* An "A+" rating from the
  <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org">Qualys SSL labs check of our TLS configuration</a>
  on 2017-01-14.
* An "A" rating from the
  <a href="https://securityheaders.io/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org">securityheaders.io check of our HTTP security headers</a>
  on 2017-01-14.
  It gives us a slightly lower score because we do not include
  "Public-Key-Pins".  This simply notes that
  we are do not implement HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP).
  HPKP counters rogue certificate authorities (CAs), but it also has problems.
  HPKP makes it harder to switch CAs *and* any error in its configuration,
  at any time, risks serious access problems that are unfixable -
  making it somewhat dangerous to use.
  As a result, we have chosen to not add HPKP at this time.
* An all-pass report from the
  <a href="https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html#hostname=bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org">SSLShopper SSL checker</a>
  on 2017-01-14.
* An "A+" rating from the [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze.html?host=bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org) scan summary
  on 2017-01-14.
* A 96% result from <a href="https://www.wormly.com/test_ssl/h/bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/i/157.52.75.7/p/443">Wormly</a>.
  The only item not passed was the "SSL Handshake Size" test; the live site
  provides 5667 bytes, and they consider values beyond 4K (with unclear
  units) to be large. This is not a security issue, at most this will
  result in a slower initial connection.  Thus, we don't plan to worry
  about the missing test.

### Detection

We have various detection mechanisms to detect problems.
There are two approaches to detection:

* internal (which has access to our internal information, such as logs)
* external (which does not have access to internal information)

We use *both* detection approaches.
We tend to focus on the internal approach, which has more information
available to it.
The external approaches do not have access
to as much information, but they see the site as a "typical" user
would, so combining these approaches has its advantages.

#### Internal

This is a [12 factor app](https://12factor.net/); as such,
events are streamed to standard out for logging.
We use the "rails_12factor" to ensure that all Rails logs go to
standard out, and then use standard Heroku logging mechanisms.
The logs then go out to other components for further analysis.

We intentionally omit here, in this public document, details about
how logs are stored and how anomaly detection is done to
detect and counter things.

#### External

We are also alerted if the website goes down.

One of those mechanisms is uptime robot:
<https://uptimerobot.com/dashboard>

### Recovery

We backup the database daily, and archive many versions so
we can restore from them.
See the [Heroku site](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-backups#scheduled-backups-retention-limits) for retention times.

The update process to the "staging" site backs up the production site
to the staging site.  This provides an additional backup, and also
serves as a check to make sure the backup process is working.

## Security of the development environment

Subversion of the development environment can easily lead to
a compromise of the resulting system.
The key developers use development environments
specifically configured to be secure.

As noted earlier, we are cautious about the components we use.
The source code is managed on GitHub;
[GitHub takes steps to keep itself secure](https://help.github.com/articles/github-security/).

The installation process, as described in the INSTALL.md file,
includes a few steps to counter some attacks.
In particular,
we use the git integrity recommendations from Eric Myhre that check all
git objects transferred from an external site into our development environment.
This sets "fsckObjects = true" for transfer (thus also for fetch and receive).

## People

Of course, it's important to have developers who know how to develop software,
with at least someone in the group who knows how to develop secure software.

The lead software developer,
[David A. Wheeler](http://www.dwheeler.com/), is an expert in the area
of developing secure software.
He has a PhD in Information Technology, a Master's degree in Computer Science,
a certificate in Software Engineering, a certificate in
Information Systems Security, and a BS in Electronics Engineering,
all from George Mason University (GMU).
He wrote the book
[Secure Programming HOWTO](http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/)
and teaches a graduate course at George Mason University (GMU) on
how to design and implement secure software.

and has been involved in software development for many years.
He has reviewed and is familiar with the security assurance case here.

## Receive CII best practices badge

The CII best practices badging project was established to identify
best practices that can lead to more secure software.
The BadgeApp application achieves its own badge.
This is evidence that the BadgeApp application is
applying practices expected in a well-run FLOSS project.
