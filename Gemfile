# Counter CVE-2015-9284 in the omniauth 1.X series.
# The omniauth gem 1.X series has a vulnerability if GET requests are used
# for login, and it was left unfixed for years. A countermeasure is using POST.
# For a discussion on this countermeasure see:
# <https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284>.
# We are *not* vulnerable, because we use the POST method for /auth; see:
# app/views/sessions/new.html.erb
# For added protection we also use a
# writing the omniauth folks STILL have not fixed it (!). There is a shim
# a third party that *does* fix it. I don't know the person who created
# this shim, but I reviewed the code and it looks okay.
# At one time I did this:
# gem 'omniauth-rails_csrf_protection',
#    git: 'https://github.com/cookpad/omniauth-rails_csrf_protection.git',
#    ref: 'b33ff2e57f7c0530da76da6b4b358218f1e7f230'
# to provide a stronger guarantee that what I reviewed is what will
# be loaded, by specifying a specific hash reference.
# However, using a git reference busts CI pipeline caching, slowing down
# all testing, and over time we've become more comfortable that this is
# the "standard way to resolve this issue".
# When we update to omniauth 2.X series we can remove this.
