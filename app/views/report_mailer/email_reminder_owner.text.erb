This is an automated reminder that your project
"<%= @project.name %>"
does not currently have a "best practices" badge,
and its badge entry has not been updated in a while.

Your best practices badge entry is at
<%= @project_info_url %>
and was last updated on <%= @project.updated_at %>.
It is currently at <%= @project.badge_percentage_0 %>% (out of 100%).

We encourage you to keep making progress.
Please visit your badge entry at
<%= @project_info_url %>
to complete the information and get your badge!

If you want to see only what you're missing, visit your badge entry,
select the button near the top labelled "Expand all panels", and
then select the button near the top labelled "Hide met or N/A criteria".
If you have questions, or need help, please contact
cii-badges-questions-owner@lists.coreinfrastructure.org
or file an issue at
https://github.com/linuxfoundation/cii-best-practices-badge/issues
(click on "new issue").

We don't send reminders if you continue to update your badge entry,
and we only send reminders approximately every 30-60 days.  However,
if you want to disable these reminder messages, edit your badge entry at
<%= @project_info_url %>
to turn on "disable inactivity reminder".
We hope you'll instead keep working at it
and eventually earn the badge.

Thank you for your time.
